fbcat (take screenshots of the framebuffer console)

fbcat takes a screenshot using the framebuffer device and stores it
in a PPM file. Also provided is a fbgrab command, which takes PNG
screenshots and supports several useful options (such as changing
consoles).

The following visuals are supported: TRUECOLOR, DIRECTCOLOR,
PSEUDOCOLOR, STATIC_PSEUDOCOLOR, MONO01, MONO10.

On the SlackBuild author's system, fbcat runs about 3x as fast as
fbdump.
