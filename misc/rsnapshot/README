rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local
and remote systems. Using rsync and hard links, it is possible to keep
multiple, full backups instantly available. The disk space required is
just a little more than the space of one full backup, plus
incrementals.

rnapshot requires both the editing of the /etc/rsnapshot.conf file and
the creation of various scripts to run at the intervals specified in the 
config file. rsnapshot comes with a multitude of example scripts located
in '/usr/doc/rsnapshot-1.3.1/utils' and has a well documented HOWTO at 
'/usr/doc/rsnapshot-1.3.1/rsnapshot-HOWTO.en.html'
It is highly recommended for you to read this HOWTO prior to altering your
configuration.

To get you up and running as quick as possible, I have provided a working 
config file and scripts located in '/usr/doc/rsnapshot-1.3.1/contrib' 
This configuration will create incremental backups every 4 hours and will
store 6 hourly, 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 3 monthly backups at a time. 
All backups will be stored in the path '/backup' which you will most 
likely want to change to fit your setup.  It is highly recommended that
the backup location be a separate physical disk or remote location.

rsnapshot is executed by adding entries into root's crontab.
There is an example crontab in '/usr/doc/rsnapshot-1.3.1/contrib/crontab'
with the necessary additions to run the scripts above.
