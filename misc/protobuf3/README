protobuf3 (Google's data interchange format)

Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
serializing structured data.

This package contains protobuf API version 3.
It support the following language implementations:
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Objective-C
* C#
* JavaNano
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* Go
* PHP (Alpha)

The complete documentation for Protocol Buffers is available at:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

NOTE: 
* This package should NOT be installed alongside with protobuf.
  Protobuf3 introduced API incompatibility and upstream will
  continue to support protobuf version 2.
* Protobuf3 enforces strict UTF-8 checking.
  Parsing will fail if a string field contains non UTF-8 data.
