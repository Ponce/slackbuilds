gcp is a file copy tool, freely inspired from cp, but with a few high-level
functionalities such as:

* transfer progression indication
* continuous copying on error (skip to next file)
* copy status logging: gcp logs all its actions so that it is possible to
  know which files have been successfuly copied
* name mangling to handle target filesystem limitations (for example
  deletion of incompatible characters "*" or "?" on FAT)
* forced copy serialization: process all copy requests sequentially in
  order to avoid useless moves of the hard disk head
* transfer lists management: you can save a list of files you copied and
  copy them again later from that list (useful for example when copying
  several times the same tracks to multiple friends)
* command-line interface similar to that of cp

This requires distribute, and progressbar is a recommended optional runtime
dependency, or you will not get the progression indication.
