rarcrack (password cracker for rar/7z/zip archives)

rarcrack uses a brute force algorithm to guess your encrypted
compressed file's password.

This program can crack zip, 7z and rar file passwords.

Optional (recommended) dependencies: At runtime, you'll need unrar to
crack rar files, and/or p7zip to crack 7z files.

Note: this is *really slow*, as it executes zip/7z/rar repeatedly,
once per generated password. If you're dealing with a zip file,
fcrackzip is much faster (but doesn't support 7z or rar).
