The recode program recognizes or produces approximately 150 character sets
and can convert almost any character set to almost any other.  When exact
translations are not possible, the program may get rid of offending characters
or use approximations. Particular attention has been paid to the proper
representation of French language diacritics.

Although we normally wouldn't put anything beta on SlackBuilds,
this release fixes some long-standing bugs that everyone else has 
been patching for years.
