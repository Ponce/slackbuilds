# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gxmessage: gxmessage (GTK xmessage clone)
gxmessage:
gxmessage: Gxmessage is an xmessage clone for GTK based desktops. Gxmessage
gxmessage: pops up a dialog window, displays a given message or question, then
gxmessage: waits for the user's response. That response is returned as the
gxmessage: program's exit code. Because gxmessage is a drop-in alternative to
gxmessage: xmessage, gxmessage accepts any option xmessage would, and returns
gxmessage: the same exit codes.
