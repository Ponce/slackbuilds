This is an update of Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and
unix2dos.  Benjamin Lin's implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos
are part of several Linux distributions such as RedHat, Fedora, Suse,
Gentoo and some others. On Slackware one finds fromdos and todos but
these implementations are not included. This update includes all RedHat
patches and fixes several other problems.

These implementations of dos2unix and unix2dos have been modelled after
dos2unix/unix2dos under SunOS/Solaris. They have similar conversion
modes, namely ascii, 7bit and iso. The first versions were made by
John Birchfield in 1989, and in 1995 rewritten from scratch by Benjamin
Lin. Mac to Unix conversion was added by Bernd Johannes Wuebben in 1998,
Unix to Mac by Erwin in 2010.

Features:
    Native language support: Dutch, English, Esperanto, German, Spanish.
    Automatically skips binary and non-regular files In-place, paired,
    or stdio mode conversion.  Keep original file dates option.  7-bit and
    iso conversion modes like SunOS dos2unix.

Dos2Unix includes: dos2unix - DOS/MAC to UNIX text file format converter
unix2dos - UNIX to DOS/MAC text file format converter
