# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xcape: released on its own. Note that it is slightly slower than pressing the 
xcape: original key, because the pressed event does not occur until the key  
xcape: is released.
xcape: 
xcape: The default behaviour is to generate the Escape key when Left Control
xcape: is pressed and released on its own.
