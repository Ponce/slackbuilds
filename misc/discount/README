discount (An implementation of Markdown text to html language in C)

This is an implementation of John Gruber’s Markdown text to html
language written by David Loren Parsons. There’s not much that
differentiates it from any of the existing Markdown implementations
except that it’s written in C instead of one of the vast flock of
scripting languages that are fighting it out for the Perl crown.
