IBus is an Intelligent Input Bus.  It is a new input framework for Linux.
It provides a full featured and user friendly input method user interface.
It also may help developers to develop input method easily.

After installing at least one engine (e.g. PinYin engine) and enabling it
in ibus-setup, ibus itself should be fully functional.  If you want to use
ibus as your primary input method, you should remove the scim package.

This requires pyxdg. By default, it uses GConf. But you can let it
use memconf instead of GConf explicitly by setting USE_GCONF=no.
GConf can be found in SBo.
If you use qt applications, then you probably want ibus-qt as well.

Thus, this requires GConf unless you choose to use memconf instead.

After installing, ibus will automatically be started in an xdg-compliant
desktop environment; if this behavior is undesirable, you can disable it
using your DE's session and/or startup management utility.
