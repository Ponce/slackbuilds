Colormake (a simple wrapper around make to colorize the output)

Colormake is a simple wrapper for making the output from make easier
to read (more colorful), and errors easier to find in messy 
compilations. It was inspired by Micheal T. Babcock's excellent 
logcolorize program.

To use, simply create a alias: alias make='colormake'
