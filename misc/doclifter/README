doclifter (convert nroff markup to XML-DocBook)

This package ships two Python scripts:

- doclifter translates documents written in troff macros (like man
  pages) to DocBook, that can then be converted to other formats or
  translated.

- manlifter is a mass-conversion script and test harness for doclifter.
  It can find and convert _all_ man pages in your system with one simple
  command.
 
See the man pages, also in HTML format in /usr/doc/docfilter*/html

docfilter's author is Eric S. Raymond.

Optional runtime dependency: plotutils. This is required for
converting PIC diagrams to SVG. Not many man pages actually require
this.
