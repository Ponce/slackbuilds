doclifter lifts documents in nroff markups to XML-DocBook.

This package ships two Python scripts:
_doclifter translates documents written in troff macros like man pages to
 DocBook, that can then be converted to other formats or translated.
_manlifter is a mass-conversion script and test harness for doclifter.
 It can find and convert _all_ man pages in your system with one simple
 command, but in a few cases.
 
See the man pages, also in HTML format in /usr/doc/docfilter*/html

docfilter's author is Eric S. Raymond.
