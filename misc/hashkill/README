Hashkill is an open-source password recovery tool.

Features:

- Multi-threaded so that it can benefit from multi-core/multi-CPU
  systems
- SSE2/AVX/XOP/AES-NI-accelerated routines to achieve high speeds on
  modern x86 CPUs
- Very powerful rule engine plus optimized bruteforce/markov codepaths
  for fast algos.
- More than 60 plugins for different types of passwords (ranging from
  simple hashes like MD5 and SHA1 to WPA, passworded RAR files, MS
  Office documents and TrueCrypt volumes)
- Supports session save/restore. Sessions are auto-saved each 3
  seconds. Password cracking can resume after the last checkpoint in
  case the program is stopped/killed/system crashes/power down/etc.
- Multi-hash support
- Fast GPU support on both Nvidia and AMD. GCN and Kepler architecture
  supported.
- Multi-GPU support (even AMD+NVidia systems).
- Session save/restore, markov/rule/bruteforce also on GPUs.

Optional dependencies:

For GPU support and kernel compilation:

 - proprietary AMD/NVidia drivers
 - opencl-headers
