This program converts the .drg proprietary file format into the open source SBaGen format.

I-Doser is a company that produces Binaural brainwaves to simulate different states.

The problem is that they don't provide a doser application for Linux, and their mp3 collection is limited,
with this program you can convert the .drg file to an .sbg and then using SBaGen (an open source application
that they use as main engine to generate the tones) you can convert it to wav and (if desired) to mp3 or similar.

This project will never be possible without the help of "The Unofficial I-Doser Blog" and their steAlth's DRG Author
by konstAnt and khAttAm to tell the truth this is a rip off stripped version of konstAnt and KhAttAm steAlth's DRG Author.
They did all the work with the .drg files, I just port some parts of it to C.

Optional dependencies :
   * sbagen (to play and/or convert sbg files to WAV);
   * lame (to convert WAV files to MP3).
