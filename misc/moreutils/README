moreutils is a growing collection of the unix tools that nobody
thought to write long ago when unix was young.

perl-IPC-Run is an optional dependency. If it's missing, chronic will
not be installed.

The 'parallel' command in moreutils conflicts with Slackware's
parallel package, so the moreutils version of parallel is not
installed by default. To install it:

  PARALLEL=yes ./moreutils.SlackBuild

Note that this will break the sbopkg 'sqg' command!
