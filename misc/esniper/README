Esniper is a simple, lightweight tool for sniping ebay auctions.

It doesn't have a lot of features, and that is by design. Auctions are specified on the command line
using the auction number and your bid price. Multiple auctions can be bid on by specifying more auctions and bid prices.
esniper stops when the desired quantity has been won (default is 1).
