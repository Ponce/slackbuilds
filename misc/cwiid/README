CWiid is a collection of Linux tools written in C for interfacing to the
Nintendo Wiimote, including an event-based API, an event/mouse/joystick
driver, and GUI/control panel.

To start cwiid's wminput daemon on boot, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.cwiid.conf
if needed (only needed if you have multiple wiimotes), then
"chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.cwiid", and add the following code to
e.g. /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.cwiid ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.cwiid start
fi
