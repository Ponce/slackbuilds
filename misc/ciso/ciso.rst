SYNOPSIS
========

ciso *level* *input-file* *output-file*

DESCRIPTION
===========

CSO (compressed ISO) images are used with the Sony Playstation
Portable game console.

**ciso** compresses ISO images to CSO, or decompresses CSO to ISO. This
is lossless compression.

To compress, set *level* to a number between 1 (least compression,
fastest) and 9 (most compression, slowest). Example::

  ciso 5 something.iso something.cso

To decompress, set *level* to 0 (zero). Example::

  ciso 0 something.cso something.iso

All 3 arguments are required. With missing arguments, **ciso** will
print its built-in usage message and exit.

The CSO images produced by *ciso* are "version 1". For more information
on the CSO image format, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.CSO
