tangogps is an easy to use, fast, and lightweight mapping application 
for use with or without GPS.  By default, tangoGPS uses map data from
the Openstreetmap project.  Additionally, a variety of other repositories 
can be easily added.  The maps are downloaded and cached for offline use 
while you drag or zoom the map.  Furthermore, you can conveniently pre-cache 
areas with tangoGPS. 

If connected to a GPS, your current position and track are shown on the map,
and you can log positional data for further processing, e.g. for geocoding 
photos or uploading streets to Openstreetmap. 

This requires ORBit2 and GConf.
