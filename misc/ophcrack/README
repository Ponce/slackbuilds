Ophcrack is a free Windows password cracker based on rainbow tables.
It is a very efficient implementation of rainbow tables done by the
inventors of the method. It comes with a Graphical User Interface
and runs on multiple platforms.

Ophcrack has a graphing function that goes with the ophcrack gui. The
graphing function depends on the "qwt" package available at
slackbuilds.org.

To enable the graphing function run the build script like this:

GRAPH=yes ./ophcrack.SlackBuild
