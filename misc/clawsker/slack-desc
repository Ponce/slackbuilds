# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

clawsker: Clawsker (applet to edit Claws Mail's hidden preferences)

clawsker: Claws Mail has a high number of configurable options and, in order
clawsker: to keep the binary small and fast, some of these preferences which
clawsker: are not widely used are not provided with a graphical interface for
clawsker: inspection and/or modification. Users wanting to edit such
clawsker: preferences had to face editing the configuration text files
clawsker: directly; now it is possible to do so with a convenient GTK2
clawsker: interface using Clawsker.
