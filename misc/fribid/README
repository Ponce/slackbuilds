FriBID is a free program for handleing e-legitimation (electronic
identification) with BankID.  With free means that the source code is
availible for everyone to study, copy and/or improve.  FriBID is cross
plattform and works on plattforms thats not supported by the official
client.

If you need PKCS#11 smartcard support then you need to use the PKCS11
variable.

The options are:
PKCS11=yes
PKCS11=runtime
yes needs opensc installed.
runtime adds runtime support and doesn't need opensc installed it
can be installed later and fribid checks for opensc when started.
Or leave it alone for disabled.

Optional dependencies:
opensc  Adds PKCS#11 smartcard support if your reader is supported
by opensc.
