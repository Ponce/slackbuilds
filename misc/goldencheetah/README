  WKO+ and the manufacturers' software for the Ergomo, Garmin, Polar,
  PowerTap, and SRM devices.
* Provides a rich set of analysis tools, including a critical power graph,
  BikeScore calculation, histogram analysis, a best interval finder, and a
  pedal force versus pedal velocity chart, to name just a few.
