This command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to current 
weather conditions and forecasts.  Presently, it is capable of returning 
data for localities throughout the USA by retrieving and formatting decoded 
METARs (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from NOAA (the USA National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration) and forecasts from NWS (the USA National 
Weather Service).  The tool is written to function in the same spirit as 
other command-line informational utilities like cal(1), calendar(1) and 
dict(1).  It can retrieve arbitrary weather data via specific command-line 
switches (station ID, city, state), or aliases can be configured system wide 
and on a per-user basis.  It can be freely used and redistributed under the 
terms of a BSD-like License. 

*SPECIAL NOTE*
This will copy the existing "/usr/bin/weather" script on the system (which 
is part of the "expect" package in Slackware) to "/usr/bin/weather.expect"
while installing the one in this package as "/usr/bin/weather.weather" and
creating a symlink to it from /usr/bin/weather.  If you remove this package
later for whatever reason, then you will need to either reinstall Slackware's
"expect" package, fix the symlink, or remove the symlink and rename the
"/usr/bin/weather.expect" file back to "/usr/bin/weather"
