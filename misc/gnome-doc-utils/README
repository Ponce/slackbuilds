gnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities
for the project. Notably, it contains utilities for building
documentation and all auxiliary files in your source tree,
and it contains the DocBook XSLT stylesheets that were once
distributed with Yelp. Starting with Gnome 2.8, Yelp will
require gnome-doc-utils for the XSLT.
