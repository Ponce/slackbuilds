dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead of the
line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the user to
specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that it takes an
optional list of characters that should be considered delimiters.
Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if they are words,
even when there is no whitespace separating them from preceding words or
delimiters. dwdiff is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff. Only the
--autopager, --terminal and --avoid-wraps options are not supported.

The default output from dwdiff is the new text, with the deleted and
inserted parts annotated with markers. Command line options are
available to change both what is printed, and the markers.

If you wish to have nl manpages and/or de, fr, nl, ru localization pass
'NLS="de fr nl ru"' (or whichever of them is wanted) to the SlackBuild.

If you wish to enable the handling of Unicode text, install the icu4c
library (also available from SlackBuilds.org) and pass "UNICODE=yes" to
the SlackBuild.
