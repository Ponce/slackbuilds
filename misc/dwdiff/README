dwdiff is a front-end for the diff program that operates at the word
level instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it
allows the user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in
that it takes an optional list of characters that should be considered
delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if they
are words, even when there is no whitespace separating them from
preceding words or delimiters. dwdiff is mostly commandline compatible
with wdiff. Only the --autopager, --terminal and --avoid-wraps options
are not supported.

The default output from dwdiff is the new text, with the deleted and
inserted parts annotated with markers. Command line options are
available to change both what is printed, and the markers.

If you wish to have de localization or nl localization and manpages,
pass 'NLS="de nl"' or either one to the SlackBuild.

If you wish to enable the handling of Unicode text, install the icu4c
library and pass "UNICODE=yes" to the SlackBuild.
