# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dwdiff: dwdiff (word-level diff program)
dwdiff:
dwdiff: dwdiff is a diff program that operates at the word level instead of
dwdiff: the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows the
dwdiff: user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that
dwdiff: it takes an optional list of characters that should be considered
dwdiff: delimiters. Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if
dwdiff: they are words, even when there is no whitespace separating them
dwdiff: from preceding words or delimiters.
