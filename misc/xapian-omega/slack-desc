# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xapian-omega:
xapian-omega: Omega is a CGI application which uses the Xapian Information Retrieval
xapian-omega: library to index and search collections of documents.
xapian-omega:
xapian-omega: The default configuration file is /etc/xapian-omega.conf. This differs
xapian-omega: from the upstream Xapian Omega default of /etc/omega.conf to avoid
xapian-omega: clashing with other applications that use /etc/omega.conf.
