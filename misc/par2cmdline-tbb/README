par2cmdline 0.4 with Intel Threading Building Blocks

This is a concurrent (multithreaded) version of par2cmdline 0.4, a utility
to create and repair data files using Reed Solomon coding. par2 parity 
archives are commonly used on Usenet posting to allow corrupted postings to
be repaired instead of needing the original poster to repost the corrupted
file(s).

Note: if you have installed the par2cmdline package this one will overwrite
the par2 binary file, so do not install both versions.
