Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and 
installing the exact gems and versions that are needed. 

Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need 
are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a 
project is as simple as bundle install.
