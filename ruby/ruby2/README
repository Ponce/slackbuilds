Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple,
straight-forward, and extensible.

Notes
======

This build script will install a newer version of ruby alongside
the provided official Slackware ruby package, however it will overwrite
/usr/lib{64}/libruby.so, so make sure to reinstall ruby package
when you remove this package.

This package is not required, as the standard Slackware
system does provide a version of ruby.

Execute using '/usr/bin/ruby2' to utilize.  All binaries
installed by this package are installed with an added "2" at the
end of each. (ruby2, rake2, irb2, gem2, erb2, rdoc2, ri2)
