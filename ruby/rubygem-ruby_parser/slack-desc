# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-ruby_parser: rubygem-ruby_parser (ruby parser)
rubygem-ruby_parser:
rubygem-ruby_parser: ruby_parser (RP) is a ruby parser written in pure ruby (utilizing
rubygem-ruby_parser: racc–which does by default use a C extension). RP's output is the
rubygem-ruby_parser: same as ParseTree's output: s-expressions using ruby's arrays and
rubygem-ruby_parser: base types.
