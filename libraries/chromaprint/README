chromaprint (audio fingerprint library)

Chromaprint is the core component of the Acoustid project.
It's a client-side library that implements a custom algorithm for
extracting fingerprints from any audio source.

ffmpeg is an optional dependency: if present it's used in place
of fftw3 for calcs and the utility fpcalc is included in the
resulting package.
