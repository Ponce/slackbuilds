RapidCheck is a C++ framework for property based testing inspired
by QuickCheck. In this testing, you define properties your code
should always satisfy given certain conditions. RapidCheck
generates random test data to find cases where the property fails.
If it finds a failure, it minimizes the input to the smallest
failing case and displays it as a counterexample.
