# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

librapidcheck:
librapidcheck: RapidCheck is a C++ framework for property based testing inspired
librapidcheck: by QuickCheck. In this testing, you define properties your code
librapidcheck: should always satisfy given certain conditions. RapidCheck
librapidcheck: generates random test data to find cases where the property fails.
librapidcheck: If it finds a failure, it minimizes the input to the smallest
librapidcheck: failing case and displays it as a counterexample.
