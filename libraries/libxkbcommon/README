xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including
loading them from disk, parsing them and handling their state.  It's
mainly meant for client toolkits, window systems, and other system
applications; currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Clutter,
and more.

This Slackbuild disables Wayland support by default. In enabling Wayland
support (which requires wayland-protocols), run the script with the
following command:

WAYLAND=yes ./libxkbcommon.SlackBuild
