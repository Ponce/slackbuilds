A simple rTorrent interface written in Python.

The xmlrpc interface to rTorrent is extremely unintuitive and has very
little documentation, this project aims to make interfacing with rTorrent
much easier.

Optional dependency is lighttpd.

NOTE: This project is considered beta, so expect the API to change. 
All API changes will be noted in the CHANGELOG.
