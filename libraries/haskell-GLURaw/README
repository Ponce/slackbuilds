GLURaw is a raw Haskell binding for the GLU 1.3 OpenGL utility
library. It is basically a 1:1 mapping of GLU's C API, intended as a
basis for a nicer interface.

This requires ghc and haskell-OpenGLRaw.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
