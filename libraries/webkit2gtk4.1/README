WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine,
suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from
hybrid HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web browsers.

It offers WebKit's full functionality and is useful in a wide range
of systems from desktop computers to embedded systems like phones,
tablets, and televisions.

NOTE:
This package builds the 4.1 WebKit API. If you need 4.0 WebKit API,
use webkit2gtk. Don't install both at the same time!!
