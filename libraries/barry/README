Barry is a GPL C++ library for interfacing with the RIM BlackBerry Handheld. It
comes with a command line tool for exploring the device and a GUI for making
quick backups. This project's goal is to create a fully functional syncing
mechanism on Linux.

This optionally depends on libxml++ for the ALX parser.
