Libgaminggear provides functions and widgets common for gaming input
devices.

For input events to work for users (needed for software macros and such)
they need access rights for uinput or uhid. To use them as normal user
you should create an extra group like

    # groupadd -r -g 317 uinput-users

and add all needed users to this group

    # usermod -a -G uinput-users $USER
