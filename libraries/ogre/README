ogre: ogre (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine)

OGRE is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to
make it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications
utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts
all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D
and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and other
intuitive classes.

SlackBuild of ogre is customizable with the following shell variables:

OGRE_BUILD_COMPONENT_PAGING
OGRE_BUILD_COMPONENT_PROPERTY
OGRE_BUILD_COMPONENT_RTSHADERS
OGRE_BUILD_COMPONENT_TERRAIN
OGRE_BUILD_PLUGIN_BSP
OGRE_BUILD_PLUGIN_PCZ
OGRE_BUILD_RENDERSYSTEM_GL
OGRE_BUILD_SAMPLES
OGRE_BUILD_TESTS
OGRE_BUILD_TOOLS
OGRE_INSTALL_DOCS
OGRE_STATIC
OGRE_CONFIG_THREADS
OGRE_CONFIG_THREAD_PROVIDER
OGRE_DEPENDENCIES_DIR

All the above can be ON/OFF except the last three definitions.

For example, in order to build samples too, launch from super user:
OGRE_BUILD_SAMPLES=ON ./ogre.SlackBuild
