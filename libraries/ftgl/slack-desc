# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ftgl: ftgl (font rendering library for OpenGL applications)
ftgl:
ftgl: FTGL is a free, open source library to enable developers to use
ftgl: arbitrary fonts in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org) applications.
ftgl: Unlike other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file
ftgl: formats so doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high
ftgl: quality font data into a lesser quality, proprietary format.
ftgl: FTGL uses the Freetype (www.freetype.org) font library to open and
ftgl: 'decode' the fonts. It then takes that output and stores it in a
ftgl: format most efficient for OpenGL rendering.
