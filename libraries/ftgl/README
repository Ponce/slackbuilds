ftgl (font rendering library for OpenGL applications)

FTGL is a free, open source library to enable developers to use
arbitrary fonts in their OpenGL (www.opengl.org) applications. Unlike
other OpenGL font libraries FTGL uses standard font file formats so
doesn't need a preprocessing step to convert the high quality font
data into a lesser quality, proprietary format. FTGL uses the Freetype
(www.freetype.org) font library to open and 'decode' the fonts. It
then takes that output and stores it in a format most efficient for
OpenGL rendering.

By default, the HTML and PDF API documentation for ftgl is not
included in the package. If you want to build the docs, export
DOCS=yes in the script's environment. You only need this if you're
developing software that uses ftgl.
