wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language.  It allows
Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional
graphical user interface simply and easily.  It is implemented as a Python
extension module (native code) that wraps the popular wxWidgets cross
platform GUI library which is written in C++.

If you want support for gnomeprint pass GNOMEPRINT=yes to the script. This
will require libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui, both available from
SlackBuilds.org.

Building the media library, which provides bindings for gstreamer,
requires GConf.

This package conflicts with wxGTK because it's already included in wxPython.
Both cannot be installed at the same time!
