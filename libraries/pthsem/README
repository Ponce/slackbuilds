pthsem is an extended version of the GNU Pth, a user mode multi threading
library, with added support for semaphores.  This package can be installed
in parallel with a normal pth, which is included in Slackware.

This version includes a patch by the developer to make pthsem use the
monotonic clock and be able to react to date and time changes more
adequately.
