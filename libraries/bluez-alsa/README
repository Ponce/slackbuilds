bluez-alsa (Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend)

This project is a rebirth of a direct integration between Bluez and
ALSA.  Since Bluez >= 5, the build-in integration has been removed in
favor of 3rd party audio applications. From now on, Bluez acts as a
middleware between an audio application, which implements Bluetooth
audio profile, and a Bluetooth audio device.

NOTE: A sample "rc" script is included, and installed in the usual
location i.e. /etc/rc.d -- to use this rc script do the usual:

chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa

Then add the following to your rc.local:

        # Start bluez-alsa
        if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa ]; then
          /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa start
        fi
