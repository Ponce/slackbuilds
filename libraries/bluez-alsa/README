bluez-alsa (Bluetooth Audio ALSA Backend)

This project is a rebirth of a direct integration between Bluez and ALSA.
Since Bluez >= 5, the build-in integration has been removed in favor of 3rd
party audio applications. From now on, Bluez acts as a middleware between an
audio application, which implements Bluetooth audio profile, and a Bluetooth
audio device.

NOTE: A sample "rc" script is included, and installed in the usual location
i.e. /etc/rc.d -- to use this rc script do the usual:
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa

Then add the following to your rc.local:
        # Start bluez-alsa
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.bluez-alsa start
        fi
