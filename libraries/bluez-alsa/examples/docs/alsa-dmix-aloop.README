# Here is an example of an alsaloop that can enable dmixing with bluez-alsa
# It might be wise to run this without the -d option and monitor under-runs until you get things dialed in just
# right. 
# If you need to increase the buffer size, then change -t 21000 to something like -t 30000
# keep in mind you'll get under-run noise if audio is idle -- you should ignore that type of under-run.
