haskell-haskeline (A command-line interface for user input)

Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line programs.
This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since it is written in 
Haskell, it is (hopefully) more easily used in other Haskell programs.

This requires ghc, haskell-mtl, haskell-terminfo, and haskell-utf8-string.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
