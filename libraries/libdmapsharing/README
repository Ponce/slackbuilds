libdmapsharing (A library that provides the DMAP family of protocols)

It is a library you may use to access and share DMAP (DAAP & DPAP)
content. The library is written in C using GObject and libsoup.
The DMAP family of protocols is used by products such as iTunes(TM),
iPhoto(TM), and the Roku SoundBridge(TM) family to share content such
as music and photos.

This requires avahi or howl.
Currently, only avahi is in slackbuilds.org.

It also requires libsoup.
