 The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling 
technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the 
solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and 
scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus 
on packages.

The package has two building methods, the default is for a single 
system (without parallelism).

* The trilinos can also be compiled against individual packages 
(i.e. amd, umfpack and metis) outside of suitesparse.SlackBuild. 
** The suitesparse.SlackBuild, doesn't build metis by default. 
For that you can use the parMETIS.SlackBuild.
For more details about dependeces the Xyce webpage.
have a list of required depences.

Optional dependences:
For enable parallelism set PARALLEL=yes. This requires the 
ParMETIS library and a MPI implementation (openmpi or mpich).
To enable CUDA set CUDA=yes (Additional requirements: CUDA
SDK and CUSPARSE).
