pyPEG2 (plain and simple intrinsic parser interpreter for Python)

pyPEG2 is a plain and simple intrinsic parser interpreter framework
for Python version 2.7 and 3.x. It is based on Parsing Expression
Grammar (PEG). With pyPEG you can parse many formal languages in a
very easy way.

NOTE: to build pyPEG2 with python3 run the slackbuild with option
PYTHON3=yes.

 # PYTHON3=yes ./pyPEG2.SlackBuild

NOTE2: In this case 'lxml' need to be build with Python3 bindings.
