This is a VA-API implementation that uses NVDEC as its backend. It is
intended primarily for Firefox and other Mozilla-based browsers to
provide accelerated video decoding for web content. Functionality in
other applications is not guaranteed and may not work correctly.

This program converts VA-API decode calls into NVIDIA's proprietary
NVDEC hardware decoding interface. This enables GPU-accelerated video
playback in applications such as Firefox, allowing smooth hardware
decoded video on sites like YouTube.

For nvidia-vaapi-driver to function correctly, several environment
variables must be set and you must be running the proprietary NVIDIA
drivers. The SlackBuild will install scripts in /etc/profile.d to load
these variables at boot. If you prefer to set them manually, run the
SlackBuild like this:

  ENVVARIABLES=no ./nvidia-vaapi-driver.SlackBuild

Then set the environment variables below using your preferred method:

  MOZ_DISABLE_RDD_SANDBOX=1
  LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia
  MOZ_X11_EGL=1
  NVD_BACKEND=direct

For instructions on configuring Mozilla-based browsers, and for other
important details, please read the README.Slackware file.
