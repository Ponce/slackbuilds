wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI applications
on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's controls and
utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.  If you do not want the unicode build, use:
  UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included there.
Both cannot be installed at the same time!
