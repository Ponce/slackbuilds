wxGTK is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's
controls and utilities.

This is a unicode shared build.  If you do not want the unicode build, use:
  UNICODE=NO ./wxGTK.SlackBuild

If you want support for gnomeprint pass GNOMEPRINT=yes to the script. This
will require libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui, both available from
SlackBuilds.org.

This package conflicts with wxPython because wxGTK is already included
there. Both cannot be installed at the same time!
