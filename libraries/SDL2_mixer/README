SDL2_mixer is a sample multi-channel audio mixer library. It supports
any number of simultaneously playing channels of 16-bit stereo audio,
plus a single channel of music.

It is safe to install alongside Slackware's SDL libraries.

Optional dependencies are:

* libmodplug (for MOD support)
* fluidsynth or TiMidity++ (for MIDI suport)
* smpeg2 (for MP3 support, not available on SBo)
