This is the official Discogs API client for Python. It enables you 
to query the Discogs database for information on artists, releases, 
labels, users, Marketplace listings, and more. It also supports 
OAuth 1.0a authorization, which allows you to change user data such 
as profile information, collections and wantlists, inventory, 
and orders.
