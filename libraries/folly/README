Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a
library of C++14 components designed with practicality and efficiency in
mind. Folly contains a variety of core library components used
extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of
Facebook's other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects
can share code.
