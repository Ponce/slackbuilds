Cdk stands for 'Curses Development Kit' and it currently contains 21 ready
to use widgets which facilitate the speedy development of full screen
curses programs.

This is a modified/enhanced version of Cdk. The intent of the modifications
is to preserve nominal compatibility with the original Cdk, while fixing
bugs and design limitations.  Some macros such as ObjOf() have been introduced
to move details out of individual widgets into common functionality (see
the cdk_objs.h header).  In addition, fixed array limits have been removed,
using new functions in some instances which do not have the fixed limits.
