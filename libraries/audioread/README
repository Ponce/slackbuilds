Decode audio files using whichever backend is available.
The library currently supports:
- gstreamer via gst0-python.
- MAD via the pymad bindings.
- ffmpeg via its command-line interface.
- The standard library wave and aifc modules (for WAV and AIFF files).

ffmpeg and gst0-python are optional dependencies.

If you want to build this for use with Python 3.x (needs the optional
dependency python3) pass the script PYTHON3=yes, like

  PYTHON3=yes ./audioread.SlackBuild
