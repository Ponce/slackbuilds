# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libconfig: libconfig (library for processing structured configuration files)
libconfig:
libconfig: Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
libconfig: files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML
libconfig: and unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
libconfig: parsing in application code. It is very compact and well-suited for
libconfig: memory-constrained systems like handheld devices. Includes bindings
libconfig: for both C and C++.
