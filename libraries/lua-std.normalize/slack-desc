# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lua-std.normalize:
lua-std.normalize: This module can inject deterministic versions of core Lua
lua-std.normalize: functions that do not behave identically across all supported Lua
lua-std.normalize: implementations into your module's lexical environment. Each
lua-std.normalize: function is as thin and fast a version as is possible in each Lua
lua-std.normalize: implementation, evaluating to the Lua C implementation with no
lua-std.normalize: overhead when semantics allow.
