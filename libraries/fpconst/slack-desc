# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fpconst: Utilities for handling IEEE 754 floating point special values.  This
fpconst: python module implements constants and functions for working with
fpconst: IEEE754 double-precision special values.  It provides constants for
fpconst: Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity
fpconst: (NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.
