libuchardet (encoding detector library)

uchardet is a C language binding of the original C++ implementation of the
universal charset detection library by Mozilla.

uchardet is an encoding detector library, which takes a sequence of bytes
in an unknown character encoding without any additional information, and attempts
to determine the encoding of the text.
