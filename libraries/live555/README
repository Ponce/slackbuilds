This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using open
standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These libraries can be used to
build streaming applications.

Since version 2014.08.26, library and include files are arranged to be
easily discoverable by configuration stage when building vlc.

Since version 2014.11.02, source tarballs from archive at
sourceforge.net are used, only the very latest tarball being available from
http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/.
