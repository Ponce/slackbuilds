# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

poppler-qt5:
poppler-qt5: Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek
poppler-qt5: Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC.  Since xpdf does not provide a shared
poppler-qt5: library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications
poppler-qt5: incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched.  By providing
poppler-qt5: a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.
