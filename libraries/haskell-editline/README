This package contains Haskell bindings to the BSD editline library.
It provides a basic interface to the editline API for reading lines of
input from the user.  Additionally, a readline compatibility module is
included which provides a subset of the functions from the readline
package.

This requires libedit and ghc.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
