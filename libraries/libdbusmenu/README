libdbusmenu (library for passing menus over DBus)

libdbusmenu is a small little library that was created by pulling out some comon
code out of indicator-applet.

It passes a menu structure across DBus so that a program can create a menu simply
without worrying about how it is displayed on the other side of the bus.
