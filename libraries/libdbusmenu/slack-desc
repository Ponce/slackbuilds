# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libdbusmenu: libdbusmenu (DBus Menu library)
libdbusmenu:
libdbusmenu: A small little library that was created by pulling out some common
libdbusmenu: code out of indicator-applet. It passes a menu structure across
libdbusmenu: DBus so that a program can create a menu simply without worrying
libdbusmenu: about how it is displayed on the other side of the bus.
