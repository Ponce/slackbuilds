RXTX is a Java library providing serial and parallel port communication.

RXTX's .info file says it requires the zulu-openjdk8 package, but other
JDKs can be used instead (e.g. openjdk8, jdk).

If you are upgrading from rxtx-2.0_7pre2, please note that the javacomm
package is no longer required and should be uninstalled before building
rxtx-2.2pre2.
