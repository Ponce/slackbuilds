The Unidata network Common Data Form (netCDF) is an interface for
scientific data access and a set of freely-distributed software
libraries that provide an implementation of the interface. The netCDF
library also defines a machine-independent format for representing
scientific data. Together, the interface, library, and format support
the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. This software
package provides Fortran application interfaces for accessing netCDF
data. It depends on the netCDF C library, which must be installed
first.
