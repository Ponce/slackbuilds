tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and powerful
Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the fastest ways to
manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses very little memory in the
process (for example the DOM tree of the XML recommendation in XML (160K)
needs only about 450K in memory)! The tDOM project was started by Jochen
Lower. It is currently maintained by Rolf Ade.

Note, tDOM ships with two extensions: tnc, an XML validation module and
tdomhtml, a set of definitions for creating html documents using tDOM.  The
slackbuild script builds and installs both by default.  If you do not wish
to build one or both of these extensions then set the BUILD_TNC and
BUILD_TDOMHTML variables to false as appropriate.
