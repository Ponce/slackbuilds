# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tDOM: tDOM (XML parsing and generation for TCL)
tDOM:
tDOM: tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and
tDOM: powerful Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the
tDOM: fastest ways to manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses
tDOM: very little memory in the process (for example the DOM tree of the
tDOM: XML recommendation in XML (160K) needs only about 450K in memory)!
tDOM: The tDOM project was started by Jochen Löwer. It is currently
tDOM: maintained by Rolf Ade.
