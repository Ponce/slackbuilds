libical is an Open Source (MPL/LGPL) implementation of the IETF's
iCalendar Calendaring and Scheduling protocols. (RFC 2445, 2446, and
2447). It parses iCal components and provides C/C++/Python/Java APIs
for manipulating the component properties, parameters, and
subcomponents.

By default c++ and python bindings are enabled. Java bindings can be
enabled by passing JAVA=yes to the script but require the jdk from
/extra to be installed.
