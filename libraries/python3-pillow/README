The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities to
your Python environment.  This library provides extensive file format
support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful image
processing capabilities.

This SlackBuild provides the PIL libraries with support for Python3.
It is intended to be a complement to python-pillow, not to replace it.

***Warning***

Pillow and PIL CANNOT co-exist in the same environment. Before
installing Pillow, please uninstall PIL.
