PyFFmpeg is a wrapper around FFmpeg's libavcodec, libavformat and
libavutil libraries whose main purpose is to provide access to
individual frames of video files of various formats (including MPEG
and DIVX encoded videos), and, also in latest beta,to audio data.

This requires Numpy, Cython, and ffmpeg.
