The Tremor Vorbis I stream and file decoder provides an embeddable, integer-only library [libvorbisidec] intended
for decoding all current and future Vorbis I compliant streams. The Tremor libvorbisidec library exposes an API intended
to be as similar as possible to the familiar 'vorbisfile' library included with the open source Vorbis reference
libraries distributed for free by Xiph.org.

Tremor can be used along with any ANSI compliant stdio implementation for file/stream access, or use custom stream i/o
routines provided by the embedded environment. Both uses are described in detail in documentation.
