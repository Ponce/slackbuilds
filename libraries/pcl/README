The Point Cloud Library (or PCL) is a large scale, open project for 2D/3D
image and point cloud processing. The PCL framework contains numerous 
state-of-the art algorithms including filtering, feature estimation, 
surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. 
These algorithms can be used, for example, to filter outliers from noisy 
data, stitch 3D point clouds together, segment relevant parts of a scene, 
extract keypoints and compute descriptors to recognize objects in the 
world based on their geometric appearance, and create surfaces from point 
clouds and visualize them -- to name a few.

Note on QT: Qt4 is used by default. If you only have Qt5, edit the option
-DPCL_QT_VERSION and set it to 5.
