muparserx is an extensible high performance math expression parser
library written in C++ originally. Originally based on the muparser
engine it has evolved into a standalone project with a completely new
parsing engine.

Whereas muparser works only scalar data types, muparserx extends the
support to strings, vector and complex data as arrays and matrices.
