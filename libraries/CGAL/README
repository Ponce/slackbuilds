The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) provides efficient and
reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library. CGAL is used in
various areas needing geometric computation, such as computer graphics,
scientific visualization, computer aided design and modelling, geographic
information systems, molecular biology, medical imaging, robotics and
motion planning, mesh generation and numerical methods.
