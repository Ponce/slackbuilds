The unixODBC Project goals are to develop and promote unixODBC to be the
definitive standard for ODBC on non MS Windows platforms.  This is to
include GUI support for both KDE and GNOME.  ODBC is an open specification
for providing application developers with a predictable API with which to
access Data Sources.  Data Sources include SQL Servers and any Data Source
with an ODBC Driver.

This will be compiled without GUI support.  If you want to give it a try,
edit the build script and comment out the "--disable-gui" configure
argument.

Also, there is a seperate GUI frontend available separately from:
http://www.unixodbc.org/gui/

NOTE: This package conflict with libiodbc in Slackware. Make sure to
reinstall libiodbc if you remove this package.
