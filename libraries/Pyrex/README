Pyrex is a language specially designed for writing Python extension modules.
It's designed to bridge the gap between the nice, high-level, easy-to-use
world of Python and the messy, low-level world of C. Pyrex lets you write
code that mixes Python and C data types any way you want, and compiles it
into a C extension for Python.
