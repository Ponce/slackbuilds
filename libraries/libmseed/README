The Mini-SEED library provides a framework for manipulation of SEED data records 
including the unpacking and packing of data records. 
Functionality is also included for managing waveform data as continuous traces. 

The library is known to work in most Unix/Linux environments (including Mac OSX) 
and in Win32 systems.
