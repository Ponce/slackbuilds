gtkhotkey (hotkey handling for Gtk+ applications)

GtkHotkey Library - Cross Platform Library For Using Desktop Wide Hotkeys.

The idea of the library is to keep it as simple as possible, while sticking
to an object oriented design, without falling back to C-isms (read: '#ifdefs')
where it would otherwise be tempting.

It can be argued that the code base is too small to be put in a separate library.
However the functionality is very well defined and would probably appear
oddly placed in some bigger helper library for GTk+ apps, where it would likely
live in a hodge podge of unrelated functionality.
