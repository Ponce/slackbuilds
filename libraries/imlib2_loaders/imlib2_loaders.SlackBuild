# - get rid of .la file.
# - add imlib2 to REQUIRES. it really is a hard dep (always was).
# - only package the license that actually applies.

# 20230213 bkw: A note about the multiple COPYING files:
#
# - COPYING is a BSD/MIT style license. It's the same as COPYING
#   for imlib2. However, the source no longer contains any of
#   the code this license once applied to, so I don't include
#   it in the package. It would be misleading to do so (see below).
#
# - COPYING-PLAIN is just the lawyer-to-English translation of
#   COPYING (again, same as imlib2). Not included for the same reason.
#
# - COPYING.loader_xcf is the actual license for the single plugin
#   this installs (xcf.so). It's a copy of the GPLv2, because the xcf
#   plugin incorporates code taken from the Gimp, which is GPLv2.
#
# If you're wondering about the ./configure message about the "eet"
# format... it can't be built. Enabling it requires some Enlightenment
# libraries. If you install those (or even if you don't), then build
# with --enable-eet, the configure script will tell you "Eet loader
# is broken". So there's no need to include whatever license the eet
# loader uses, as we can't include the code anyway.
#
# This is more excruciating detail than anyone really cares about.
# It's mostly a note to myself, to remind me why I didn't include all
# 3 COPYING* files in the package.
