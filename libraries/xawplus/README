XawPlus is a clone of the original Xaw library, providing a more 
up to date look and some extensions to the original Athena widget
set. This library is as compatible as possible to the original. 

XawPlus makes it possible to use XPM pixmaps, tooltips, a truncate
mechanism for too long label strings and UTF8 coded UNICODE labels
without changing the code of your application.
