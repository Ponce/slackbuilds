# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libevhtp: libevhtp (libevent HTTP API)
libevhtp:
libevhtp: Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's current HTTP
libevhtp: API. The reality of libevent's http interface is that it was created
libevhtp: as a JIT server, meaning the developer never thought of it being used
libevhtp: for creating a full-fledged HTTP service. Infact I am under the
libevhtp: impression that the libevent http API was designed almost as an
libevhtp: example of what you can do with libevent. It's not Apache in a box,
libevhtp: but more and more developers are attempting to use it as so.
