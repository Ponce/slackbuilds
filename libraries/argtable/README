Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line
arguments with a minimum of fuss. It enables the programmer to
define their program's argument syntax directly in the source code
as an array of structs. The command line is then parsed according
to that specification and the resulting values stored directly into
user-defined program variables where they are accessible to the
main program.
