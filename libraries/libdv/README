The Quasar DV codec (libdv) is a software codec for DV video.  DV is the 
encoding format used by most digital camcorders, typically those that support 
the IEEE 1394 (aka FireWire or i.Link) interface.  libdv was developed 
according to the official standards for DV video, IEC 61834 and SMPTE 314M.
