libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked
music files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream.
Is based on the player code of the OpenMPT project (Open ModPlug
Tracker).
This script packages also openmpt123, a cross-platform command-line
or terminal based module file player, shipped with the library.
