SOIL is a tiny C library used primarily for uploading textures into
OpenGL. It is based on stb_image version 1.16, the public domain code
from Sean Barrett. The author has extended it to load TGA and DDS
files, and to perform common functions needed in loading OpenGL
textures. SOIL can also be used to save and load images in a variety
of formats (useful for loading height maps, non-OpenGL applications,
etc.)
