# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libeditline: libeditline (Line editing library)
libeditline:
libeditline: This is a line-editing library. It can be linked into almost
libeditline: any program to provide command-line editing and recall.
libeditline: It is call-compatible with a subset of the FSF readline library,
libeditline: but it is a fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).
libeditline: This package contains the runtime library only.
