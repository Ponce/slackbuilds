The Wayland display server

Wayland is a project to define a protocol for a compositor to talk
to its clients as well as a library implementation of the protocol.
The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux
kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a
wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional applications,
X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.

Optional Dependency

Building man and html documentation is optional. If you want to build
that, install graphviz and execute the slackbuild with

  GRAPHVIZ=yes ./wayland.SlackBuild
