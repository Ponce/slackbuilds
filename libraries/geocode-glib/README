geocode-glib is a convenience library for the geocoding (finding 
longitude, and latitude from an address) and reverse geocoding 
(finding an address from coordinates). It uses Nominatim service to 
achieve that. It also caches (reverse-)geocoding requests for faster 
results and to avoid unnecessary server load.

Below variables can be used to configure the build:
  GTKDOC=yes          : Builds gtkdocs
  INTROSPECTION=no    : Disables the introspection generation
  TESTS=yes           : Build & install test programs
