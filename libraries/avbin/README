AVbin is a binary release of a cross-platform, thin wrapper 
around Libavâ€™s video and audio decoding library, providing 
long-term binary compatibility for applications and languages 
that need it.

AVbin was originally created for the Pyglet project as its media 
decoding/decompression library, though we hope others find AVbin 
useful as well.
