WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine,
suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from
hybrid HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web browsers.

It offers WebKit's full functionality and is useful in a wide range
of systems from desktop computers to embedded systems like phones,
tablets, and televisions.

NOTE:
This package builds the 4.0 WebKit API. If you need 4.1 WebKit API,
use webkit2gtk4.1. Don't install both at the same time!!

If your application is not working well after upgrading to this
version, consider adding this environment variable before running
the application:
export WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1
