haskell-HTTP (A Haskell library for client-side HTTP)

The HTTP package supports client-side web programming in Haskell.
It lets you set up HTTP connections, transmitting requests and
processing the responses coming back, all from within the comforts
of Haskell.

This requires haskell-network.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
