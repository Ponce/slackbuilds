Eeze is part of Enlightenment DR17 foundation libraries.

Eeze is a library for manipulating devices through udev with a simple
and fast api. It interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such
middleman daemons as udisks/upower or hal, to immediately gather device
information the instant it becomes known to the system.

This requires ecore.
