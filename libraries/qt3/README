Qt is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.

This release is free only for development of free software for the X Window
System. If you use Qt for developing commercial or other non-free software,
you must have a professional license. Please see 
http://qt.nokia.com/products/licensing for details on the licensing
options.

This script builds the older qt3 library that coexists with the newer qt4
library. It was adapted from the original version from Slackware 13.1 but
uses the newer PNG and JPEG libraries.
