qt3 (multi-platform C++ graphical user interface toolkit, version 3)

Qt is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.

This release is free only for development of free software for the
X Window System. If you use Qt for developing commercial or other
non-free software, you must have a professional license. Please see
http://qt.nokia.com/products/licensing for details on the licensing
options.

This script builds the older qt3 library, which coexists with newer
versions of the library. It was adapted from the original version from
Slackware 13.1 but uses the newer PNG and JPEG libraries.
