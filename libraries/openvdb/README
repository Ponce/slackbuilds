OpenVDB is an Academy Award-winning open-source C++ library comprising
a novel hierarchical data structure and a suite of tools for the
efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data
discretized on three-dimensional grids. It was developed by DreamWorks
Animation for use in volumetric applications typically encountered in
feature film production and is now maintained by the Academy Software
Foundation (ASWF).

OpenVDB can be compiled with Houdini (not on SBo), if someone needs
support for it, feel free to modify the slackbuild to set

-DOPENVDB_BUILD_HOUDINI_PLUGIN=ON

VDB is a format for storing "volumetric data", such as fog, clouds,
and "point cloud" in scientific data.

IMPORTANT:

openvdb REQUIRES llvm-20.1.8 from slackware64-15.0/extra
