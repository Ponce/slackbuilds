# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libnet: Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application
libnet: programmer to construct and inject network packets. It provides a
libnet: portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet shaping
libnet: handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet
libnet: creation from the application programmer such as multiplexing, buffer
libnet: management, arcane packet header information, byte-ordering,
libnet: OS-dependent issues, and much more.
