qt4 (a C++ graphical user interface toolkit, legacy version)

Qt is a complete and well-developed object-oriented framework for
developing graphical user interface (GUI) applications using C++.

This is an older 'legacy' version of Qt, only intended to support
older applications that have not yet been ported to Qt5. Don't use
this for developing new code.

If you're a SBo maintainer working on a script that requires qt4, see
README_SBo.txt for some helpful hints.

This qt4 does *not* include qt4-webkit, and there is no separate
qt4-webkit SlackBuild. qt4-webkit is outdated, EOLed, and has security
issues that will never be fixed. Nobody should still be using it at
this late date.
