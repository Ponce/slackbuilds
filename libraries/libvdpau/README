This package contains the libvdpau wrapper library and the libvdpau_trace 
debugging library, along with the header files needed to build VDPAU 
applications. To actually use a VDPAU device, you need a vendor-specific 
implementation library, like the one shipped with nvidia's binary graphics 
driver.

NOTE: Be careful when using this together with the nvidia binary installer 
(the .run file), as the same files included in this package are also included 
in the binary installer.  As upstream recommends splitting those files into a 
separate package, this shouldn't cause any issues, but in case it does, you 
have been warned.  There is no such problem when using this together with the 
nvidia-driver SlackBuild on SlackBuilds.org.

graphviz is an optional dependency (for building the docs).
