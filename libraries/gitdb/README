Git Object Database.

GitDB is a pure-Python git object database.

GitDB allows you to access bare git repositories for reading and writing.
It aims at allowing full access to loose objects as well as packs with
performance and scalability in mind. It operates exclusively on streams,
allowing to operate on large objects with a small memory footprint.
