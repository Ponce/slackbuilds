LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus
on high performance and good code. The library differentiates itself
from other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to
the network stack. On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at
3 times the speed of the official client.

This requires libsigc++.
