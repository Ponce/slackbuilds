libpaper is a library for handling paper characteristics.

The libpaper paper-handling library automates recognition of many
different paper types and sizes for programs that need to deal with
printed output.

Pass the variable PAPERSIZE=letter|a3|a4|... to the script to set the
preferred papersize (the default is a4).
