libunibreak (a line breaking library)

Libunibreak is an implementation of the line breaking and word
breaking algorithms as described in Unicode Standard Annex 14 and
Unicode Standard Annex 29.

It is designed to be used in a generic text renderer. FBReader is one
real-world example, and the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries are
another.
