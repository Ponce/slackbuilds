ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a method for comparing levels of 
some continuous response variable between different groups. The main 
idea is to compare variation within each group to variation between 
the groups; if the groups vary considerably from one group to another 
in comparison to the within group variation, we can reject the null 
hypothesis that all the groups have similar levels of the response 
variable.

TAMU ANOVA contains both single and two factor ANOVA. Use of the 
package can be facilitated through linking to the compiled library 
tamuanova. The package function definitions are accessible through 
tamu_anova.h. The program must still be linked to the GSL (see GSL 
documentation on linking and compiling.)

This requires gsl.
