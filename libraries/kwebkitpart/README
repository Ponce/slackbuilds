KWebKitPart is a web browser component for KDE (KPart) based on (Qt)WebKit.
You can use it for example for browsing the web in Konqueror.

KWebKitPart is still in early development and thus not guaranteed to be in
production quality yet.

KDE 4.4 or greater is required for building and running KWebKitPart.
