libcsv (library to read/write comma-separated-value data)

libcsv is a small, simple and fast CSV library written in pure ANSI
C89 that can read and write CSV[*] data. It provides a straightforward
interface using callback functions to handle fields and rows, and can
parse improperly formatted CSV files.

[*] libcsv is capable of using any delimter, not just commas.

For command-line tools that use this library to manipulate CSV files,
see system/csvutils.
