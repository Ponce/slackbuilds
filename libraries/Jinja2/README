Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python.  It provides a
Django inspired non-XML syntax but supports inline expressions and
an optional sandboxed  environment.

This requires pysetuptools.

Circular dependencies warning: The DOCS=yes flag needs Sphinx, which
needs Jinja2, which needs Sphinx because DOCS=yes ... So...  If you
really need the docs, build Jinja2 without the DOCS=yes flag, build
Sphinx, then rebuild Jinja2 with DOCS=yes.  Incidentally, unless you
are a developer, you don't normally need the DOCS=yes flag.
