libcapsimage (decoder library for KyroFlux CTR and IPF disk images)

libcapsimage is a support library that allows applications to access
low-level disk image files stored in the IPF (Interchange Preservation
Format) and CTR ("CT Raw") formats. This library is also known as the
"SPS Decoder Library", spsdeclib, and was formerly known as ipflib.

In particular, this library allows hatari (and various other emulators)
to use the low-level IPF and CTR dumps found on many ST archive sites.

This isn't free software: see /usr/doc/libcapsimage-$VERSION/LICENCE.txt
for details. The short version is that it's free for non-commercial use.
