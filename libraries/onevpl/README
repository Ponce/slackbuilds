The Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) is the successor
to Intel Media SDK. This library takes you from abstractions for
integrated graphics to using oneVPL to unlock media features on a
much broader range of accelerators.

The oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) provides a single video
processing API for encode, decode, and video processing that works
across a wide range of accelerators.

To include examples (available in /usr/share/onevpl/examples) pass
EXAMPLES=yes to the slackbuild as

   EXAMPLES=yes ./onevpl.SlackBuild
