The Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) is a free, industrial quality library for
simulating articulated rigid body dynamics. Proven applications include
simulating ground vehicles, legged creatures, and moving objects in VR
environments. It is fast, flexible and robust, and has built-in
collision detection.
