notify-sharp is a C# client implementation for Desktop Notifications, i.e.
notification-daemon. It is inspired by the libnotify API.

Desktop Notifications provide a standard way of doing passive pop-up
notifications on the Linux desktop. These are designed to notify the user of
something without interrupting their work with a dialog box that they must
close. Passive popups can automatically disappear after a short period of time.
