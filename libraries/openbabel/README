OpenBabel is a project designed to pick up where Babel left off, as
a cross-platform program and library designed to interconvert between
many file formats used in molecular modeling, computational chemistry,
and many related areas.    

Optional dependency: if you want the graphical interface (obgui),
install wxPython or wxGTK3 (either will do) before running this
script.
