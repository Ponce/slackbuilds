# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zend-opcache: zend-opcache (PHP opcode caching and optimization)
zend-opcache:
zend-opcache: The Zend OPcache provides faster PHP execution through opcode
zend-opcache: caching and optimization. It improves PHP performance by
zend-opcache: storing precompiled script bytecode in the shared memory.
zend-opcache: This eliminates the stages of reading code from the disk and
zend-opcache: compiling it on future access. In addition, it applies a few
zend-opcache: bytecode optimization patterns that make code execution faster.
