libbluray is an open-source library designed for Blu-Ray Discs playback for
media players, like VLC or MPlayer.  libbluray integrates navigation, playlist
parsing, menus and BD-J.  libbluray is DRM-circumvention free, and thus, safe to
integrate in your software.

Optional runtime dependencies: libaacs and libbdplus

Optional build time dependency is graphviz, apache-ant and jdk. To build the
extra bdjava capabilities, apache-ant and jdk are needed.  Then run the
slackbuild as:

    BDJAVA=yes sh libbluray.SlackBuild

Most commercial Blu-Ray are protected by AACS or BD+ technologies and this
library is not enough to playback those discs.

Note: The xine plugin has been disabled because it requires xine-lib > 1.2.0.
