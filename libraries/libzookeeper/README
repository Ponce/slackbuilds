libzookeeper provides a C client interface to Zookeeper server.
The Apache ZooKeeper system for distributed coordination is 
a high-performance service for building distributed applications.

This only builds C client library from zookeeper release tarball.
So you don't need JDK and full local zookeeper installation 
to build and use distributed applications like sheepdog
distributed storage.
