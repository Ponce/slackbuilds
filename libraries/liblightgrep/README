Lightgrep is a new regular expression engine, designed specifically for digital
forensics. Why another regexp engine?

Lightgrep:

  - searches for many patterns simultaneously
  - searches binary data as a stream, not as discrete lines of text
  - searches for patterns in many different encodings; give it dirty data, 
    lightgrep don't care
  - never, ever, ever, never, never looks at a byte twice or backs up in your 
    input

Lightgrep is still pretty new and doesn't have all the regexp features you 
might be used to. But it has enough features to be more than a toy, and what 
is supported is well-tested.
