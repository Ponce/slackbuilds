gnome-media is a set of media utilities and libraries for configuring 
media-related options for GNOME.

If you want to build gnome recorder, pass USE_GRECORD=yes to the script 
when building.  If you want to disable GStreamer properties, pass 
USE_GSTPROP=no to the script.  To enable the (deprecated) GStreamer 
mixer, pass USE_GSTMIX=yes to the script.
