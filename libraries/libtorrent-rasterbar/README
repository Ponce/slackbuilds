libtorrent is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative to all the
other bittorrent implementations around. It is a library and not a full
featured client, although it comes with a working example client.

*When upgrading, please removepkg the old version first or the python
module will try to link against it*


OPTIONS

  To build examples and copy them to /usr/doc/...:

  EXAMPLES=yes ./libtorrent-rasterbar.SlackBuild


NOTE

It is possible to build with bindings for python3 rather
than python2 by setting the $PYTHON environmental variable,
but this would involved rebuilding boost with bindings for
python3 first.

Go ahead and make my day.
