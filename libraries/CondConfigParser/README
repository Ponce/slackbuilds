CondConfigParser is a Python library designed to help developers of Python
applications to parse configuration files. Compared to well-known modules such
as ConfigParser and json, CondConfigParser allows the user to define conditions 
using boolean operators and specific sections in the configuration file, which
are only applied when the corresponding condition is fulfilled.
