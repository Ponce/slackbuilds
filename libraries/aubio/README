aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing
pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio. The name aubio comes from 'audio' with a typo:
several transcription errors are likely to be found in the
results too.

jack and ffmpeg are optional dependencies.

The python bindings are built if numpy is available and the python3
ones are built if numpy3 is available: if both versions of python
are present in the system, the aubio and aubiocut python scripts
will use python3.
