aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing
pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio. The name aubio comes from 'audio' with a typo:
several transcription errors are likely to be found in the
results too.

jack-audio-connection-kit and ffmpeg are optional dependencies.

To build the python bindings, pass BINDINGS=yes to the script.
This depends on numpy.
