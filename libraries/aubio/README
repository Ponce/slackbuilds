aubio is a library for audio labelling. Its features include
segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, performing
pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from
live audio. The name aubio comes from 'audio' with a typo:
several transcription errors are likely to be found in the
results too.

jack and ffmpeg are optional dependencies.

The python2 bindings are built if python2-numpy is available and
the python3 ones are built if python3-numpy is available: if both
versions of numpy are present in the system, the aubio and aubiocut
python scripts will use python3.
