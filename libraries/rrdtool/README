RRDTool is the industry standard data logging and graphing application.

This package makes all bindings that are supported on the system.  Bindings for
Lua and libdbi (optional dependencies) will be made automatically if they
are detected, this can be changed with: LUA=no LIBDBI=no ./rrdtool.SlackBuild
