# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libopenraw: libopenraw (a library for camera RAW file decoding)
libopenraw:
libopenraw: libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software
libopenraw: implementation for camera RAW files decoding. One of the main
libopenraw: reasons is that dcraw is not suited for easy integration into
libopenraw: applications, and there is a need for an easy to use API to
libopenraw: build free software digital image processing application.
libopenraw:
libopenraw: It also has the goal to address missing features from dcraw
libopenraw: like meta-data decoding and easy thumbnail extraction.
