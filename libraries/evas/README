Evas is part of Enlightenment DR17 foundation libraries.

Evas is a hardware-accelerated canvas API for X-Windows that can draw
anti-aliased text, smooth super and sub-sampled images, alpha-blend,
as well as drop down to using normal X11 primitives such as pixmaps,
lines and rectangles for speed if your CPU or graphics hardware are
too slow.

This requires eina, and optionally eet.
