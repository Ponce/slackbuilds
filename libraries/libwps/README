Libwps is a library (for use by word procesors, for example) for
importing the Microsoft Works word processor file format. As of
December 2006, the project is new, but it imports Works format
versions 2, 3, 4, 5 (aka 2000), and 8 with some formatting. The
scope of this project is just a Works word processor import filter,
so there are no plans for supporting an export filter, spreadsheets,
or databases. It is a part of the Document Liberation Project.

To build the doxygen html documentation use DOC="yes".
