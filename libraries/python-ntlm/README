Python library that provides NTLM support, including an authentication
handler for urllib2. Works with pass-the-hash in additon to password
authentication.

This library is useful for passing hashes to servers requiring ntlm
authentication in instances where using windows tools is not desirable.

It allows Python clients running on any operating system to provide NTLM
authentication to a supporting Windows server.

Usage and Examples located in /usr/doc/python-ntlm-$VERSION/README.md.
