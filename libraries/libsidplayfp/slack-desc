# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libsidplayfp: libsidplayfp (SID emulation)
libsidplayfp:
libsidplayfp: Libsidplayfp (and its console frontend sidplayfp) is a fork of
libsidplayfp: sidplay2 born with the aim to improve the quality of emulating the
libsidplayfp: 6581, 8580 chips and the surrounding C64 system in order to play
libsidplayfp: SID music better.
