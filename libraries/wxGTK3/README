wxGTK3 is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native
platform's controls and utilities.

webkitgtk and webkitgtk3 are optional dependencies of this package.
This will provide webview support.

NOTE:
this package is NOT built using --enable-stl by default.
if you need to enable stl, use:
STL=yes ./wxGTK3.SlackBuild

If you need to build static version, use:
STATIC=yes ./wxGTK3.SlackBuild
When building with static libraries, plugin support will be disabled.

This script also auto-detect webkitgtk presence. If it's installed,
it will automatically use --enable-webkit parameter.

wxGTK3 can be installed alongside with wxGTK/wxPython, but it will
overwrite wx-config created by wxGTK/wxPython.
If you need to build packages using wxGTK/wxPython, simply
reinstall wxGTK/wxPython package and wx-config will point to correct version.
The same solution can be used if wxGTK3's wx-config is overwritten.
