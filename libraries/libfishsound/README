libfishsound (unified API for xiph.org audio codecs)

libfishsound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and
encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (FLAC, Speex and Vorbis).

libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and
provides a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been
designed for use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct
dependencies on Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly used
in conjunction with liboggz to decode or encode FLAC, Speex or Vorbis
audio tracks in Ogg files, including Ogg Theora and Annodex.
