SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library that allows changing
the sound tempo, pitch, and playback rate parameters independently from each
other. For example:
- tempo can be increased or decreased while maintaining the original pitch
- pitch can be increased or decreased while maintaining the original tempo
- Change playback rate that affects both tempo and pitch at the same time
- Choose any combination of tempo/pitch/rate
