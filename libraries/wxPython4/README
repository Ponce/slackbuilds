wxPython4 (Crossplatform GUI Toolkit)

wxPython is a cross-platform GUI toolkit for the Python programming language.
It allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly
functional graphical user interface, simply and easily.

It is implemented as a set of Python extension modules that wrap the GUI
components of the popular wxWidgets cross platform library, which is written
in C++.

wxPython is a cross-platform toolkit. This means that the same program will
run on multiple platforms without modification.

Currently Supported platforms are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and macOS,
and Linux or other unix-like systems with GTK2 or GTK3 libraries.
In most cases the native widgets are used on each platform to provide
a 100% native look and feel for the application.
