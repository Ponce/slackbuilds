CEGUI - windowing and widget library

Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and widgets for 
graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not natively available, or 
severely lacking. The library is object orientated, written in C++, and 
targeted at games developers who should be spending their time creating great 
games, not building GUI sub-systems!

The configure script for CEGUI will detect whether or not you have an optional 
dependency installed or not and will enable/disable the option accordingly.  
However, you may want to specify this yourself.  In particular, pay attention 
to the image codecs because you might want to disable the others to ensure that
the one you want to use is the default codec.

Some of the optional libraries include:
  Xerces-C++ XML parser (xerces-c at SlackBuilds.org)
  LibXML XML parser (libxml at SlackBuilds.org)
  DevIL image loading library (DevIL at SlackBuilds.org)
  FreeImage image loading library (FreeImage at SlackBuilds.org)
  Corona image loading library (NOT available at SlackBuilds.org)
  Others perhaps - see output of "configure --help"
