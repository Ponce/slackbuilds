libaaio is a software library providing the functionality of getch(), getche()
and kbhit() on Linux and UNIX systems (including Mac OS X). It does not
require an initialization (like curses) and does not abuse the terminal (i.e.
whenever the mode of the terminal is changed its state is stored so it can be
restored).

The software has not seen any changes since 2005, but remains useful for
programs that still require it (e.g., beta releases of the Composer's Desktop
Project tools).
