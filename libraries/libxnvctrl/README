The NV-CONTROL X extension provides a mechanism for X clients to query and set
configuration parameters of the NVIDIA X driver. State set by the NV-CONTROL X
extension is assumed to be persistent only for the current server generation.
This can be useful for programs such as conky, mate-sensors-applet, and
xfce4-sensors-plugin to allow for realtime monitoring of your NVIDIA cards temperature, fan speed, memory, etc.
