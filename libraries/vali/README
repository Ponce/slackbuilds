vali (C library for Varlink)

vali is a C library that implements the Varlink protocol, a lightweight
IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanism designed as a simpler
alternative to D-Bus. Varlink uses a JSON-based protocol with an interface
definition language (IDL) for defining services and methods.

The library generates code from Varlink interface definitions and handles
both client and service implementations. It supports asynchronous
operations on the service side and provides clear separation between input
and output parameters through generated structs. vali is particularly
useful for tools that need IPC functionality without the complexity of
D-Bus.
