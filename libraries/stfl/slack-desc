# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

stfl: STFL (the Structured Terminal Forms Language/Library)
stfl:
stfl: STFL is a library which implements a curses-based widget set for text
stfl: terminals. The STFL API can be used from C, SPL, Python, Perl and
stfl: Ruby. The public STFL API is only 14 simple function calls big and and
stfl: there are already generic SWIG bindings. Thus it is very easy to port
stfl: to additional scripting languages.
