INDI is a distributed control protocol designed to operate astronomical
instrumentation. INDI is small, flexible, easy to parse, and scalable.
It supports common DCS functions such as remote control, data acquisition,
monitoring, and a lot more.

This script builds the library that KDE KStars and similar programs can
use for image capture in astrophotography, telescope control, etc.

You will need libindi-drivers (also on SBo) to fully utilize INDI hardware.
