# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

liboil: liboil (a library of simple functions)
liboil:
liboil: Liboil is a library of simple functions that are optimized for 
liboil: various CPUs. These functions are generally loops implementing 
liboil: simple algorithms, such as converting an array of N integers to 
liboil: floating-point numbers or multiplying and summing an array of N 
liboil: numbers. Such functions are candidates for significant optimization 
liboil: using various techniques, especially by using extended instructions 
liboil: provided by modern CPUs (Altivec, MMX, SSE, etc.).
