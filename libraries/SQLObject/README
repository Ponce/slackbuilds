SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.  SQLObject includes a 
Python-object-based query language that makes SQL more abstract, and 
provides substantial database independence for applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB
(SAPDB).

This requires pysetuptools and FormEncode.  Also, docutils, if installed,
is used to build html docs at build time, but that is optional.

NOTE: SQLObject checks for supported databases at run time.
Following Python modules are needed for the actual databases: MySQLdb
for MySQL, psycopg or pgdb for PostresSQL, pysqlite for SQLite,
kinterbasdb for Firebird, Sybase for Sybase, adodbapi or pymssql for
MSSQL, and sapdb for MaxDB.
