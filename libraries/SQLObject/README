SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing an
object interface to your database, with tables as classes, rows as
instances, and columns as attributes.  SQLObject includes a
Python-object-based query language that makes SQL more abstract, and
provides substantial database independence for applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL and MaxDB
(SAPDB).

This requires pysetuptools and FormEncode.  Also, docutils, if installed,
is used to build html docs at build time, but that is optional.

NOTE: SQLObject checks for supported databases at run time.  You can
find MySQL-python and psycopg2 (MySQL and PostrgreSQL support,
respectively) modules on SlackBuilds.org.  For SQLite, SQLObject can
use the standard Python module sqlite3, or an externally installed
PySQLite2.  For the rest, check the SQLObject documentation for links.
