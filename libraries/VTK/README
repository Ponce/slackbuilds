The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely
available software system for 3D computer graphics, modeling,
image processing, volume rendering, scientific visualization and
information visualization. VTK also includes ancillary support for
3D interaction widgets, two and three-dimensional annotation, and
parallel computing. At its core VTK is implemented as a C++ toolkit,
requiring users to build applications by combining various objects
into an application. The system also supports automated wrapping of
the C++ core into Python, Java and Tcl, so that VTK applications may
also be written using these interpreted programming languages.

Some optional additional packages, if detected during configuration,
are used in preference to versions provided in the source code. These
packages, available from SlackBuilds.org, are:
    jsoncpp proj

You can enable a number of optional features by passing variables to
the script (VAR=yes|no ./VTK.SlackBuild):

IMAGING=yes|no  (default: yes)
MPI=yes|no      (default: no), requires openmpi
TK=yes|no       (default: yes)
VIEWS=yes|no    (default: yes)
WEB=yes|no      (default: no), requires python3-twisted
JAVA=yes|no     (default: no), requires jdk
PYTHON=yes|no   (default: yes)
QT=yes|no       (default: yes)

NB. Some combinations of options are known to result in compilation
errors if the build machine already has VTK installed. Please remove
any VTK installation before running the SlackBuild.
