Epoxy is a library for handling OpenGL function pointer management for you.

It hides the complexity of dlopen(), dlsym(), glXGetProcAddress(),
eglGetProcAddress(), etc. from the app developer, with very little knowledge
needed on their part. They get to read GL specs and write code using
undecorated function names like glCompileShader().

libepoxy can be used during the build process of xorg-server. To enable the use
of libepoxy, edit the x/x11/configure/xorg-server file in the Slackware source
tree, and add this configure flag to the ./configure section:

--enable-glamor \

*Note*: If you have installed the wayland-1.6.0 package from SBo, you can build
Xwayland server for usage with a Wayland capable display compositor.

This package requires MesaLib be installed prior to building from the Slackware
default package schema.
