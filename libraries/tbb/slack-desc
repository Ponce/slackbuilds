# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tbb: tbb (Intel Threading Building Blocks)
tbb:
tbb: Intel TBB offers a rich and complete approach to expressing
tbb: parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you take
tbb: advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be
tbb: a threading expert. Intel TBB is not just a threads-replacement
tbb: library. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that
tbb: abstracts platform details and threading mechanisms for scalability
tbb: and performance.
