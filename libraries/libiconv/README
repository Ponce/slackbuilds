libiconv (conversion library for text encodings)

Some programs, like mailers and web browsers, must be able to convert 
between a given text encoding and the user's encoding.  Other programs 
internally store strings in Unicode, to facilitate internal processing, 
and need to convert between internal string representation (Unicode) 
and external string representation (a traditional encoding) when they 
are doing I/O.  GNU libiconv is a conversion library for both kinds of 
applications.
