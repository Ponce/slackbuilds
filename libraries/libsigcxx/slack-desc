libsigc++:
libsigc++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++. It
libsigc++: allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
libsigc++: callback function, either global or a member function, regardless
libsigc++: of whether it is static or virtual.
libsigc++: It also contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar
libsigc++: callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback
libsigc++: libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU Library General
