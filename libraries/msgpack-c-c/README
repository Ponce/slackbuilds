MessagePack is an efficient binary serialisation format that lets you
exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. 

Versions later than 3.3.0 have separate C and C++ implementations.
This slackbuild builds only the C implementation of MessagePack. 
If you need also the C++ implementation you have to build and install 
the package msgpack-c-cpp even. Both packages can coexist.

Note: msgpack-c-c conflicts with the old msgpack-c package, that
implements both C and C++ but is based on old outdated release of
msgpack-c. If you have msgpack-c version 3.3.0 in your system, please
remove it before installing these package.

This slackbuild is experimental because some slackbuilds that require
msgpack-c should be updated. If your installed packages work still with
the old msgpack-c for version 3.3.0, you should kept it.
