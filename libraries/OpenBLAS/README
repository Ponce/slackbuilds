OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.

Added symbolic link to install a generic blas library that can be used by
Octave and R.
OpenBLAS has cpu specific targetted assembly code for speed optimisation.
If running in a vm with QEMU cpu you need to specify a variable
TARGET=cpuname to the script where cpuname is one from the list in the
sourcecode file TargetList.txt
examples are TARGET=NEHALEM for an Intel i7 or TARGET=ATHLON for AMD Athlon
