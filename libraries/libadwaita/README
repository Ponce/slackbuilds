Libadwaita is a GTK4 library implementing the GNOME HIG, complementing
GTK. Libadwaita is the successor of libhandy, but for GTK4.

Among other things, libadwaita provides a set of widgets built on top of
GTK4 as well as the "Adwaita" theme, a coloring API, and a mechanism to
make apps linked against it fit in with a system-wide dark mode
preference.

Build options:

BUILDTYPE => customize build type by setting to a value recognized by
meson; eg, BUILDTYPE=debug (defaults to 'release').

GTK_DOC => set to 'true' to build API documentation; requires
`gi-docgen` (defaults to 'false').
