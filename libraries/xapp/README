In the long term Xapps are there to provide applications to users
in multiple DEs, but also to provide building blocks, resources
and libraries to Linux developers who want to develop applications
which work well in multiple DEs.

This project is still relatively new though and we can't yet
commit to a stable ABI.

You are welcome to use libxapp or xapps-common in your application,
but if you do, please make sure to tell us, so that we can
communicate with you going forward about any potential changes.
