INDI Third Party Device Hardware Drivers

INDI is a distributed control protocol designed to operate astronomical
instrumentation. INDI is small, flexible, easy to parse, and scalable.
It supports common DCS functions such as remote control, data
acquisition, monitoring, and a lot more.

This script builds several third party hardware drivers.  The required
build and install sequence is:

libindi -> libindi-libraries -> libindi-drivers

Some optional hardware dependecies are:
fxload       download firmware into FX, FX2, and FX2LP EZ-USB devices
             and devices and I2C serial EEPROMs (SBo)

Notes:
1. Some of the drivers will need additional configuration of their
   dependencies, e.g. gpsd for GPS devices.
2. Not all device drivers are implemented yet since their dependencies
   are not yet available on Slackbuilds.org.  This is a work in
   progress.
