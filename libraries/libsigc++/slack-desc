# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsigc++:
libsigc++: libsigc++ implements a typesafe callback system for standard C++.
libsigc++: It allows you to define signals and to connect those signals to any
libsigc++: callback function, either global or a member function, regardless
libsigc++: of whether it is static or virtual.
libsigc++: It also contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar
libsigc++: callbacks and has an ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback
libsigc++: libraries. Libsigc++ is licensed under the GNU Library General
