This package provides a software library for manipulating ID3v1
and ID3v2 tags. It provides a convenient interface for software
developers to include standards-compliant ID3v1/2 tagging
capabilities in their applications.

Features include identification of valid tags, automatic size
conversions, (re)synchronisation of tag frames, seamless tag
(de)compression, and optional padding facilities.

This SlackBuild applies several patches provided by Debian team.
