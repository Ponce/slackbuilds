Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework.  Qt's
primary feature is its rich set of widgets that provide
standard GUI functionality.

The following are optional dependencies that Qt will link
against if they are detected at build time:

libwebp, opus, ffmpeg, pcre2, snappy, libminizip, jsnoncpp,
libinput, unixODBC, postgresql, SDL2, assimp, wayland,
OpenAL, protobuf(3?), and perhaps more.

============================================================

OPTIONS

To use Qt's built-in ccache option:

  CCACHE=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

See README.benchmarks for the benefits of using ccache.

To build the documentation:

  DOCS=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

To build the examples:

  EXAMPLES=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

To build support for proprietary media codecs:

  PROPRIETARY_CODECS=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

(this will produce a non-redistributable package in some
countries)

To disable support for pulseaudio:

  PULSEAUDIO=no ./qt5.SlackBuild

(Qt will automatically detect if pulseaudio is not installed
at build time and disable it if it is missing.)

To NOT build qtwebengine (EXPERIMENTAL):

  WEBENGINE=no ./qt5.SlackBuild

To use the gold linker:

  LDGOLD=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

This may speed up the build, but can take more RAM.

Combine any or all of the above.

============================================================

GENERAL NOTES

After upgrading Qt5 it is important to rebuild qt5ct too, if
it is installed, or some applications may not display or
function correctly.

There is a qt5-legacy (5.9.9) SlackBuild that is available
for older applications that do not run correctly with this
version.  However it will not coexist with this version.

Please report any problems about applications that don't
work correctly to the Qt5 maintainer or to the mailing list.

============================================================

NOTES ON OPTIONS

* Using ccache should speed up subsequent rebuilds, but may
  be slower for first time or one-off builds.

* Building the documentation and/or examples creates a
  significantly larger package.

============================================================

BUILDING WITHOUT WEBENGINE

Building without webengine can speed up compilation.

If you have no intention of using the browser code, which
includes a chunk of 3rd party Google Chromium source, then
it may make sense to skip it and save yourself about 2/3 of
the build time.

The package version has _nowebengine appended to it for
clarity.

* Successfully tested so far without webengine (VERY quick
  tests):

  QMPlay2
  qt5ct
  qbittorrent-qt5
  speedcrunch
  qca-qt5
  psi-plus
  sddm
