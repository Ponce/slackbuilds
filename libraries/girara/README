girara (GTK+ based GUI for text-oriented applications)

girara is a library that implements a user interface that focuses on
simplicity and minimalism. girara was designed to replace and enhance
the user interface that is used by zathura and jumanji and other
features that those applications share.

Note: Previous version of girara were based on gtk+-2.x. This version
is based on 3.x, so any software that uses girara will likely need to
be rebuilt when girara is upgraded.
