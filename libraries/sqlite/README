SQLite is a small C library that implements a self-contained, embeddable, 
zero-configuration SQL database engine.

The SQLite distribution comes with a standalone command-line access program 
(sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite database and which serves 
as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
