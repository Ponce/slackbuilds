This library provides an Haskell interface to the terminfo database
(via bindings to the curses library).  Terminfo allows POSIX systems
to interact with a variety of terminals using a standard set of
capabilities.

This requires ghc.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
