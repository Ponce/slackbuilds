The bigfloat module is a Python wrapper for the MPFR library for arbitrary
precision floating-point reliable arithmetic.

The MPFR library is a well-known portable C library for arbitrary-precision
arithmetic on floating-point numbers. It provides precise control over
precisions and rounding modes and gives correctly-rounded reproducible
platform-independent results.

The bigfloat module aims to provide a convenient and friendly Python
interface to the operations and functions provided by the MPFR library. The
main class, BigFloat, gives an immutable multiple-precision floating-point
type that can be freely mixed with Python integers and floats. The Context
class, when used in conjunction with Pythons with statement, gives a simple
way of controlling precisions and rounding modes. Additional module-level
functions provide various standard mathematical operations. There is full
support for IEEE 754 signed zeros, nans, infinities and subnormals.
