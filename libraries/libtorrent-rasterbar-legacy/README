libtorrent-rasterbar is a C++ library that aims to be a good alternative
to all the other bittorrent implementations around. It is a library and
not a full featured client, although it comes with a working example
client.

*When upgrading, please removepkg the old version first or the python
module will try to link against it*

OPTIONS

  To build examples and copy them to /usr/doc/...:

  EXAMPLES=yes ./libtorrent-rasterbar-legacy.SlackBuild

NOTE

It is possible to build with bindings for python3 rather than python2 by
setting the $PYTHON environmental variable, but this would involve
rebuilding boost with bindings for python3 first.

Go ahead and make my day.
