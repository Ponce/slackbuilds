glktermw (library for textmode interactive fiction)

Glk defines a portable API (programming interface) for applications with
text UIs (user interfaces). It was primarily designed for interactive
fiction, but it should be suitable for many interactive text utilities,
particularly those based on a command line.

glktermw is a curses (ncurses) implementation of the Glk API, with wide
character (aka Unicode) support.
