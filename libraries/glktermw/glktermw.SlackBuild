# Slackware build script for glktermw

# Notes:

# Upstream doesn't support shared libraries. I could patch the Makefile
# and do a shared lib, but I'd be inventing my own shared-lib versioning
# scheme (see office/mupdf/README_shared.txt for my reasons not to want
# to do this).

# Using -Os rather than -O2 in SLKCFLAGS. This makes the static library
# 15% smaller with no noticeable difference in speed, since a text game
# spends most of its time waiting for the user to type something. Please,
# SBo admins, don't change this unless you have evidence that the
# optimization is causing an actual problem with running software that
# links to the library. Currently only one thing links with it (fizmo)
# and I've tested it pretty thoroughly.

# The includes get installed in /usr/include/glktermw instead of directly
# in /usr/include as upstream recommends. This is because remglk (another
# glk implementation) wants to install slightly different headers in
# the same place... so both get subdirectories.
