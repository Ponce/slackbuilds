Pylast is a python interface to Last.fm.
Try using the pydoc utility for help on usage.

For more info check out the project's home page at http://code.google.com/p/pylast/

If you want to build this for use with Python 3.x (needs the optional
dependency python3) pass the script PYTHON3=yes, like:

  PYTHON3=yes ./pylast.SlackBuild
