lvtk (LV2 toolkit C++ wrappers)

LV2 Toolkit is a set C++ wrappers around the LV2 C API.  The included
libraries ease writing LV2 plugins and UIs in C++ by inheriting from
easy to use template classes.

If you want to build the API documentation, install graphviz, then export
DOCS=yes before running lvtk.SlackBuild. This is only useful if you plan
to develop your own code that uses lvtk. The docs take up 4MB of space
in /usr/doc/lvtk-$VERSION/html/ (which makes the package 5x the size it
would be without the docs). Also, the example plugins will be installed
in /usr/lib(64)?/lv2/ltvk.lv2/, for another 500KB or so.
