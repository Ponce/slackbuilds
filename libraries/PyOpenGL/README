PyOpenGL is the cross platform Python binding to OpenGL and related APIs.  
The binding is created using the standard (in Python 2.5 and above) ctypes 
library and is provided under a BSD-style Open-Source license.

PyOpenGL includes support for OpenGL v1.1 through 3.2, GLU, GLUT v3.7 (and 
FreeGLUT), and GLE 3.  It also has support for hundreds of OpenGL extensions.

PyOpenGL is interoperable with a large number of external GUI libraries for 
Python including wxPython, Pygame, PyGTK, and Qt.  It can also use the GLUT 
library to provide basic windowing and user interface mechanisms.
