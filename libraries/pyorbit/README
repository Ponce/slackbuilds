PyORBit is a binding for the ORBit2 CORBA ORB. It aims to be
compatible with the Python language mapping standard, implementing
both the client side and server side bindings. PyORBit is capable of
calling methods of in-process ORBit servers implemented in C, and
being called by C code.

Requires ORBit2, available at SlackBuilds.org
