R3 is an URL router library with high performance, thus, it's
implemented in C. It compiles your R3Route paths into a prefix
trie.

By using the prefix tree constructed in the start-up time, you
can dispatch the path to the controller with high efficiency.

Optional dependencies:
 - Grapviz: rendering Routes With Graphviz
   GRAPHVIZ=yes ./libr3.SlackBuild
