# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

libisoburn: libisoburn (Frontend for libburn and libisofs)
libisoburn:
libisoburn: libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and libisofs which
libisoburn: enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all
libisoburn: CD/DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW,
libisoburn: which do not support multi-session management on media level and even
libisoburn: plain disk files or block devices. The price for that is thorough
libisoburn: specialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images.
