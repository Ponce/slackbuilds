zita-convolver (audio convolution engine)

No dependencies, but there are some build options:

SSE - Use or don't use SSE for floating point math. Default is "auto",
which checks the build host CPU for SSE support. You can override this
with SSE=yes or SSE=no if you're going to install the package on a
different host from the build host (or maybe if you know for a fact,
due to benchmarking, that your CPU's SSE implementation is slow or
buggy).

MMX - Use or don't use MMX. Default is "auto". Set MMX=yes or MMX=no
to override.

FORCE_O2 - Normally, Slackware packages are built with the
optimization set to -O2. This package defaults to -O3 (because
that's what upstream uses), but if you *really* want, you can set
FORCE_O2=yes. I can't think of a good reason to do this, you probably
can't either :)

With no options, the default is to build a package optimized for the
build host (which is just what you want, if you're going to build and
install on the same machine).

Warning to guitarix users: if you upgrade zita-convolver and guitarix
stops working, you'll have to rebuild guitarix. This is because
guitarix links to the system zita-convolver library if it's installed
(but otherwise uses its own bundled copy).
