GLFW is a free, Open Source, multi-platform library for opening a
window, creating an OpenGL context and managing input. It is easy to
integrate into existing applications and does not lay claim to the
main loop.

GLFW is written in C and has native support for Windows, Mac OS X and
many Unix-like systems using the X Window System, such as Linux and
FreeBSD.

GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

This is version 3 of GLFW with an incompatible API to GLFW 2.
