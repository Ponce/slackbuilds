Very fast, header-only/compiled, C++ logging library.

fmt is an optional dependency and will be autodetected if installed.

This scripts builds both 32bit and 64bit libraries by autodetecting
multilib and if you pass COMPAT32=yes to the build script (this
needs a 32bit fmt installed in your system)
