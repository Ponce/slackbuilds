libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based
on ECMA-234. The general purpose of this library is to create
vector graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into
StarOffice/OpenOffice.  The library is also used by pstoedit to
convert postscript and pdf files to EMF format.

This might build with 32-bit compat libs on x86_64, but definitely not
without them.
