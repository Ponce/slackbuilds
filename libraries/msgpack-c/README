MessagePack is an efficient binary serialisation format that lets you
exchange data among multiple languages like JSON. msgpack-c is a C and
C++ implementation of MessagePack.

Note: this is the lastest version of msgpack including both C and C++
implementations. Later versions have separate implementations for these
languages. This slackbuild is maintained for compatibility with
some slackbuilds which require msgpack-c.

If you want install a newer version (>=6.0.0) please refer to following
packages:
- msgpack-c-cpp for only C++ implementation
- msgpack-c-c for only C implementation
(both packages can coexist)
