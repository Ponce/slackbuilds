libmp3splt (library from the mp3splt project)

The mp3splt project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files, selecting
a begin and an end time position, without decoding. It's very useful
to split large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire
albums to obtain original tracks. If you want to split an album,
you can select split points and filenames manually or you can get
them automatically from CDDB (internet or a local file) or from .cue
files. Supports also automatic silence split, that can be used also
to adjust cddb/cue splitpoints. You can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap or
AlbumWrap files in few seconds.

The mp3splt project is divided into 3 parts (all available from SBo):
 - libmp3splt, a library (created from mp3splt version 2.1c)
 - mp3splt, a command line program
 - mp3splt-gtk, a gtk2 gui
