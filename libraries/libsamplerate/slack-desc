# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

libsamplerate: libsamplerate (Sample Rate Converter for audio)
libsamplerate:
libsamplerate: Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter
libsamplerate: for audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is
libsamplerate: converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz
libsamplerate: sample rate used by DAT players. SRC is capable of arbitrary 
libsamplerate: and time varying conversions. SRC provides a small set of 
libsamplerate: converters to allow quality to be traded off against 
libsamplerate: computation cost.
