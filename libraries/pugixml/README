pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like
interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely
fast XML parser which constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer
and an XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries.
Full Unicode support is also available, with Unicode interface
variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings.
