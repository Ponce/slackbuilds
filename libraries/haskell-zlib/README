This is a library for Haskell programs. It provides a pure interface for
compressing and decompressing streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings.
It uses the zlib C library so it has high performance. It supports the "zlib",
"gzip" and "raw" compression formats.

This requires ghc.

After uninstalling, run the following command to unregister the package
from the ghc package database:   ghc-pkg recache
