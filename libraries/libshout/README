Libshout is a library for communicating with and sending data to an
icecast server.  It handles the socket connection, the timing of the
data, and prevents bad data from getting to the icecast server.

With just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any application
into a streaming source for an icecast server.  Libshout also allows 
developers who want a specific feature set (database access, request taking)
to concentrate on that feature set, instead of worrying about how server
communication works.
