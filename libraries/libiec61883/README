This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers 
and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of 
IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.

The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV, MPEG-2
and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and transmission.
It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which transparently provides 
mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer.
