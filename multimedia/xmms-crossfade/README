xmms-crossfade (A Crossfade/Gapless plugin for XMMS)

This plugin can be used to remove the gaps between two songs, or to 
smoothly crossfade inbetween.

Features:
 
    * Crossfading
      Crossfade between two songs, i.e. fade out the end of the current song 
      while fading in the beginning of the next for a smooth transition. Length 
      and volume of the fadings can be adjusted separately for fading in and 
      out.
    
    * Fadein/Fadeout
      Smoothly fadein/fadeout at the beginning or end of playback.

    * Continuous output
      Keeps the audio device opened when switching from one song to the next. 
      When used with the Gap-Killer, this allows for seamless playback of whole 
      albums without any audible interruption between the tracks.

    * Gap-Killer
      Removes the short gaps of silence at the beginning and/or end of mp3 
      files. These gaps are caused by some mp3-encoders.

    * Automatic detection of live albums
      Automatically detects live albums and pre-mixed tracks which already are 
      crossfaded. For those tracks, crossfading can be disabled automatically.

    * High quality
      XMMS-crossfade can take special care to avoid the clicks some 
      soundcards produce when suddenly being stopped. Also, it can improve 
      quality when seeking within a song.

    * Secondary effect plugin:
      XMMS-crossfade allows you to select a second effect plugin. This is 
      usefull for example when using the volume normalizing plugin together 
      with the icecast plugin.
