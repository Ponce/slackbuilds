xmms-crossfade (A Crossfade/Gapless plugin for XMMS)

This plugin can be used to remove the gaps between two songs, or to 
smoothly crossfade inbetween.

Features:
 
* Crossfading
  Crossfade between two songs, i.e. fade out the end of the current
  song while fading in the beginning of the next for a smooth
  transition. Length and volume of the fadings can be adjusted
  separately for fading in and out.

* Fadein/Fadeout
  Smoothly fadein/fadeout at the beginning or end of playback.

* Continuous output
  Keeps the audio device opened when switching from one song to
  the next.  When used with the Gap-Killer, this allows for seamless
  playback of whole albums without any audible interruption between
  the tracks.

* Gap-Killer
  Removes the short gaps of silence at the beginning and/or end of mp3
  files. These gaps are caused by some mp3-encoders.

* Automatic detection of live albums
  Automatically detects live albums and pre-mixed tracks which already
  are crossfaded. For those tracks, crossfading can be disabled
  automatically.

* High quality
  XMMS-crossfade can take special care to avoid the clicks some
  soundcards produce when suddenly being stopped. Also, it can improve
  quality when seeking within a song.

* Secondary effect plugin:
  XMMS-crossfade allows you to select a second effect plugin. This is
  useful for example when using the volume normalizing plugin together
  with the icecast plugin.
