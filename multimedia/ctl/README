The Color Transformation Language, or CTL, is a programming language
for digital color management.

Digital color management requires translating digital images between
different representations or color spaces. The Color Transformation
Language, or CTL, is a small programming language that was designed to
serve as a building block for digital color management systems.

CTL allows users to describe color transforms in a concise and unambiguous
way by expressing them as programs. In order to apply a given
transform to an image, the color management system instructs a CTL
interpreter to load and run the CTL program that describes the
transform. The original and the transformed image constitute the CTL
program's input and output.
