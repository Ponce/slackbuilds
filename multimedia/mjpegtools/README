The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos and
playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of audio
and video under Linux.

Recording is supported for the Zoran based cards like the Buz (Iomega),
DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle), Matrox Marvel cards and the LML33 (Linux Media Labs).
See related pages to the right to find the right driver for your card.
The recorded videos can be converted to MPEG streams. The software playback
of MPEG streams works with almost every player and every OS.
You can produce special forms of MPEG streams like VCD (Video CD) and SVCD
for hardware playback.

This optionally depends on libquicktime, libdv and SDL_gfx.
