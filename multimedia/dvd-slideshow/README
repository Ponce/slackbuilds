dvd-slideshow is a group of Linux commandline programs that creates a
slideshow-style dvd from groups of pictures. Slideshow videos can be
made from a directory or some online photo albums. You can add fancy
effects like fades, titles, and the Ken Burns effect along with audio
to make your slideshows even nicer.

This requires dvdauthor, ffmpeg, lame, oggvideotools.
