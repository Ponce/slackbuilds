LosslessCut aims to be the ultimate cross platform FFmpeg GUI for
extremely fast and lossless operations on video, audio, subtitle
and other related media files.

The main feature is lossless trimming and cutting of video and audio
files, which is great for saving space by rough-cutting your large
video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you
quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many
gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing
quality. There are also many more use cases.
Everything is extremely fast because it does an almost direct data
copy, fueled by the awesome FFmpeg which does all the grunt work.
