VLC media player is a free and open source media player and multi-
media framework written by the VideoLAN project. VLC is a portable
multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and
video codecs and file formats as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various
streaming protocols. It is able to stream over networks and to
transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats.

This build aims to support as many options as possible using
the SlackBuilds listed in the REQUIRES field of the vlc.info file.
No script changes are necessary to include particular options; if they
are detected at build time, they will be included. Conversely if
optional packages are not available at build time, vlc will continue
to build with a reduced feature set.

The vsxu SlackBuild is now optional for x86 machines; removed from
REQUIRES since it does not compile on arm machines at the moment.

Please advise the maintainer to suggest support for any further options.

NOTES for slackware current:
- the qt4 interface seems not to be working ATM so the qt5 one is
  enabled by default: this means qt5 is a new mandatory dependency
- you *need* to version-bump the libva and libva-intel-driver in
  Slackware current to versions 1.7.3 before building this or either
  disable VAAPI entirely in the script adding "--enable-libva=no"
  between the configure options
