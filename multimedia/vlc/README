VLC media player is a free and open source media player and multi-
media framework written by the VideoLAN project. VLC is a portable
multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and
video codecs and file formats as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various
streaming protocols. It is able to stream over networks and to
transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats.

This build aims to support as many options as possible using
the SlackBuilds listed in the REQUIRES field of the vlc.info file.
No script changes are necessary to include particular options; if they
are detected at build time, they will be included. Conversely if
optional packages are not available at build time, vlc will continue
to build with a reduced feature set.

This SlackBuild also builds in support for BlackMagic Design's "Decklink"
range of video input and output cards, including those with UHD (3840x2160)
capability.

Please advise the maintainer to suggest support for any further options.
