Flowblade Movie Editor is a multitrack non-linear video editor for
Linux released under GPL 3 license.

It is designed to provide a fast, precise and as-simple-as-possible
editing experience.

It employs film style editing paradigm in which clips are
usually automatically placed tightly after the previous clip - or
between two existing clips - when they are inserted on the
timeline. Edits are fine tuned by trimming in and out points of clips,
or by cutting and deleting parts of clips. Film style editing is
faster for creating programs with mostly straight cuts and audio
splits, but may be slower when programs contain complex composites
unless correct work flow is followed.

Optional recommended dependencies are swh-plugins and calf.
