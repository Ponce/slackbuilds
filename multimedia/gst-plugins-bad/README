GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests,
a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

This optionally depends on TiMidity++, aom, amrnb, amrwb, celt, faac, faad2
flite, gsm, libass, libcdaudio, libdc1394, libdca, libfdk-aac, libkate,
liblrdf, libmimic, libmodplug, libmusicbrainz, libofa, libquicktime,
lv2, musepack-tools, opencv, rtmpdump, schroedinger, soundtouch, swfdec
nvidia*driver, and xvidcore.

Note that if you have any version of the nvidia drivers installed the
script will autodetect them and will try to build its nvdec support,
requiring the presence on the system of cudatoolkit too: as cudatoolkit
is *huge*, cuda support is disabled by default but it can be explicitly
enabled passing the script the variable CUDA=yes
