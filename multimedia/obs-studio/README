This project is a rewrite of what was formerly known as "Open Broadcaster Software", software originally designed for recording and streaming live video content, efficiently.

For full functionality, plug-ins using jack-audio-connection-kit and vlc will be constructed if those packages (all available at SBo) are detected at build time.
