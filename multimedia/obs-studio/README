This project is a rewrite of what was formerly known as "Open Broadcaster
Software", software originally designed for recording and streaming live
video content, efficiently.

For full functionality, plug-ins using jack, luajit and vlc will be
constructed if those packages (all available at SBo) are detected at
build time.
