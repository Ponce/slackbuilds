DevedeNG is a program to create video DVDs and CDs (VCD, sVCD, or CVD)
suitable for home players from any number of video files, in any of
the formats supported by MPlayer.

The suffix NG is because it is a rewrite from scratch of the old Devede,
to work with Python3 and Gtk3, and with a new internal architecture that
allows to expand it and easily add new features.

DevedeNG has some optional dependencies for some of its features:
VLC, MPV, Brasero
