MPlayer plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI, OGG/OGM, VIVO, ASF/WMA/WMV, QT/MOV/MP4,
FLI, RM, NuppelVideo, YUV4MPEG, FILM, RoQ, PVA files, supported by many
native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx,
DivX 3/4/5 and even WMV movies, too (without the avifile library).

The required codecs are available from the MPlayer site, and we have a
SlackBuild script for them as well.  If you have already installed the
codecs on your own, then make sure the CODECSDIR variable in the script
is defined correctly (or pass the correct value on the command line when
running the SlackBuild script).

This script is written to install the default "Blue" theme for MPlayer, and
it will print an error (but allow you to continue) if you don't have the
theme tarball in the build directory.  You can obtain the Blue theme here:
	http://www.mplayerhq.hu/MPlayer/skins/Blue-1.7.tar.bz2
If you want to install some other theme, the script is written to support
that, but other themes have not been tested with it.  The best option for
using additional themes/skins is to install them in $HOME/.mplayer by
following the directions on the MPlayer homepage.

You can speed-up decoding and encoding by passing RUNTIME_CPU=no to the build
script.

MPlayer supports DVD-Menu-Navigation; for it to work as expected, you will
need to either write "mouse-movements=yes" into your mplayer.conf or start mplayer
as "mplayer dvdnav:// -mouse-movements"
