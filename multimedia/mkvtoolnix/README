MKVToolnix is a set of tools to create, alter and inspect Matroska
(and WebM) files. With these tools one can:

  * Get information about Matroska files (mkvinfo)
  * Extract tracks/data from Matroska files (mkvextract)
  * Create Matroska files from other media files (mkvmerge)
  * Modify properties of existing Matroska files (mkvpropedit)

Note: This comes with internal versions of libembl and libmatroska.
Configure will use the internal versions if it fails to find them or
they are unusable.

The script will build QT GUI by default. It can be disabled by GUI=no

It is also possible to install translation of man pages. It requires
po4a to be installed. Configure catches it automatically.
