Gnome MPlayer has a rich API that is exposed via DBus. Using DBus you
can control a single or multiple instances of GNOME MPlayer from a
single command.  Gnome MPlayer is not dependent on any Gnome libraries.  
However, the look and feel of the application is based on the Gnome HIG.

Either dconf or gconf is required for the program to save settings; they
are no longer stored in a flat text .conf file.  If you plan to use gconf,
pass "GCONF=YES" to the script.  libmusicbrainz3 is an optional dependency.
