LiVES is a Video Editing System. It is designed to be simple to use,
yet powerful. It is small in size, yet it has many advanced features.

LiVES mixes realtime video performance and non-linear editing in one
professional quality application. It will let you start editing and
making video right away, without having to worry about formats, frame
sizes, or framerates. It is a very flexible tool which is used by
both professional VJ's and video editors - mix and switch clips from
the keyboard, use dozens of realtime effects, trim and edit your
clips in the clip editor, and bring them together using the
multitrack timeline. You can even record your performance in real
time, and then edit it further or render it straight away.

For the more technically minded, the application is frame and sample
accurate, and it can be controlled remotely or scripted for use as a
video server. And it supports all of the latest free standards.

LiVES is good enough to be used as a VJ tool for professional
performances, and as a video editor is capable of creating dazzling
clips in a huge variety of formats.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read

capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
