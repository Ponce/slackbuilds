Farsight Audio/Video Communications Framework

The Farsight project is an effort to create a framework to deal with all 
known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a generic 
API that makes it possible to write plugins for different streaming protocols
and on the other side it offers an API for clients to use those plugins. 

This requires libnice and gst-python to build, and gst-plugins-ugly to run.
