# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

farsight2:
farsight2: The Farsight project is an effort to create a framework to deal
farsight2: with all known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side
farsight2: it offers a generic API that makes it possible to write plugins
farsight2: for different streaming protocols, on the other side it offers
farsight2: an API for clients to use those plugins.
