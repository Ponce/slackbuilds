l-smash (open source mp4 handler)

l-smash is a set of simple open source tools for the mp4 container. It
rivals Mp4Box from GPAC in muxing, demuxing and tagging mp4, mov, 3gp,
3g2, m4a and m4v files.

Included in the package are four executables: boxdumper, muxer,
remuxer, and timelineeditor. There are no man pages for these, but
each one can be run with --help to see usage information.
