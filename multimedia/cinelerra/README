Cinelerra CV is the most advanced non-linear video editor and compositor
for Linux. It does primarily 3 main things: capturing, compositing,
and editing audio and video with sample level accuracy.

NOTE:
Patches for ffmpeg-2.x from the official website are included in this SlackBuild.
These patches work for the most part, but in various cases (like loading multiple DNxHD files)
they make the program very unstable.

If you still want to build with ffmpeg-2.x, pass "EXTERNALFFMPEG=yes" to the commandline.
