Cinelerra is the most advanced non-linear video editor and compositor
for Linux.   It does primarily 3 main things: capturing, compositing,
and editing audio and video with sample level accuracy.

This is a development version maintained by Einar Rünkaru:
  http://git.cinelerra.org/gitweb?p=einar/cinelerra.git;a=summary
This build script uses a git snapshot that was downloaded and hosted
by the script maintainer.

By default cinelerra builds with an internal ffmpeg. Building with
an external, system-wide installed ffmpeg is no longer possible.

Cinelerra requires a52dec, imlib2, libdv, faac, faad2 x264, lame, 
libavc1394, libiec61883, and mjpegtools.
