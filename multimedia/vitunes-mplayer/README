vitunes-mplayer (frontend for mplayer, with vi key bindings)

vitunes is a curses-based music player and playlist manager for *nix
whose goals are: 1. a minimalistic appearance, 2. strong vi-like
bindings, and 3. quick playlist creation/management. vitunes does not
strive to be a feature-rich media player, but rather a quick, vi-like
media indexer and playlist manager, that just happens to be able to
play the music it indexes.

Note about the package name: There exist 2 completely separate things
called "vitunes". If you're looking for the vim frontend for iTunes,
this isn't it.
