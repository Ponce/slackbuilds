LiVES is a frame and sample accurate realtime and non-linear video editor.
Features include keyboard-based editing, a dedicated clip editor, JACK
support, realtime effects, support for most major multimedia formats, the
ability to be used for live VJ'ing, and much more.

In the unlikely event that you are running Pulse Audio on Slackware, you
should use the build option PULSE=yes but the default assumes you do NOT
have Pulse and applies an important patch to turn Pulse options off. In
other words, most people will NOT use any build option here.
