Audio-recorder (Audio recorder for GNOME and Unity Desktops)

This amazing program allows you to record your favourite music and 
audio to a file. It can record audio from your system's sound card, 
microphones, browsers, webcams & more. Put simply; if it plays out 
of your loudspeakers you can record it.

It has an advanced timer that can:
  * Start, stop or pause recording at a given clock time.
  * Start, stop or pause after a time period.
  * Stop when the recorded file size exceeds a limit.
  * Start recording on voice or sound (user can set the audio 
    threshold).
  * Stop or pause recording on "silence" (user can set the audio 
    threshold and delay).

After you first run the application it will autostart at every login, 
you can disable this in the "Additional settings". It also offers a 
convenient appindicator.

Optional dependencies to record MP3 and M4A formats:
