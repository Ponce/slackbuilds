Pragha is a Lightweight Music Player for GNU/Linux, based on Gtk and
sqlite. It is completely written in C, constructed to be fast, light,
and simultaneously tries to be complete without obstructing the daily
work. ;)

Main features:

 * Full integration with GTK+3, but always completely independent of
   gnome or xfce.
 * Two panel design inspired by Amarok 1.4: Library & current playlist.
 * Library with multiple views, according to tags or folder structure.
 * Search, filter and queue songs on current playlist.
 * Play and edit tags of mp3, m4a, ogg, flac, asf, wma, and ape files.
   Limited only by codecs installed and taglib version used.
 * Playlist management: Export M3U and read M3U, PLS, XSPF and WAX
   playlists.
 * Playback control with command line.
