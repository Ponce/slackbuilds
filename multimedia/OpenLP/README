OpenLP stands for "Open Lyrics Projection" and is presentation software
developed for churches to provide a single easy to use interface for the
projection needs of a typical worship service. 
First created in 2004, it has steadily grown in features and maturity such
that it is now a mainstay in hundreds of churches around the world.

OpenLP has searchable databases of songs and Bible verses allowing them to be
projected instantly or saved in a pre-prepared order of service file. Themes
allow for a variety of presentation options and allow you to add attractive
visuals to enhance your presentations. PowerPoint and OpenOffice presentations,
videos and audio files can be run from within the program removing the need
to switch between different programs. Alert messages can be displayed so the
nursery or car park stewards can notify the congregation easily. 
Remote capability allows the worship leader to change songs, or for alert
messages to be sent from anywhere on the network, even via smart phone/tablet.
