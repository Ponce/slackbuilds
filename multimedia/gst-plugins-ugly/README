GStreamer Ugly Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that have good quality and
correct functionality, but distributing them might pose problems.  The
license on either the plug-ins or the supporting libraries might not be
how we'd like. The code might be widely known to present patent problems.

This optionally depends on opencore-amr, lame, libdvdcss, libmpeg2, 
twolame, and x264.
