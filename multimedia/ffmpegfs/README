FFmpegfs is a read-only FUSE file system which transcodes
various audio and video formats to mp4, WebM and many more
on the fly when opened and read using the ffmpeg library
thus supporting a multitude of input formats and a variety
of common output formats.

By default only root has access to this filesystem
for other users, uncomment user_allow_other in
/etc/fuse.conf

fop is an optional dependency needed for genetating
pdf documents. To generate pdf docs run
make help-pdf and copy the pdf to the doc dir by
customizing the slackbuild

Example:

ffmpegs --desttype=mp4 input_dir output_dir -o allow_other,rw
