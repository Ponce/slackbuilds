 Yolo is a Java program for creating timesheets to sync animation to a pre-recorded audio track.

Specifically, Yolo analyses a WAV file against plain text sides, and, given a frame rate, generates an exposure sheet.
Animators can use the exposure sheet to sync the lips of an animated character with the dialogue.

Yolo does not parse the words contained within the WAV file on its own; you must provide it both the audio and the
scripted dialogue. As long as it has these two things, it effectively provides a phonemic breakdown of the dialogue,
an example drawing of the mouth position, and a frame count for each sound.
