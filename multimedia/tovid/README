tovid is a collection of GPL video disc authoring tools; it can help you
create your own DVDs, VCDs, and SVCDs for playback on your home DVD player.
The CLI scripts are particularly handy for automating disc creation.

transcode is a recommended, optional dependency.
txt2tags is only needed to build man pages from git/svn sources.
