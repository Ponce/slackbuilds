DSSI (pronounced "dizzy") is an API for audio processing plugins, particularly
useful for software synthesis plugins with user interfaces.

DSSI is an open and well-documented specification developed for use in Linux
audio applications, although portable to other platforms. It may be thought of
as LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to VSTi.

This requires ladspa_sdk, liblo, libsndfile and jack.
