musique (cross-platform music player)

Musique is just another music player, only better. Musique unclutters
your music listening experience with a clean and innovative interface.

Notes:

- musique is a Qt5 application. It integrates nicely with KDE, but
  doesn't require KDE to run.

- If musique notifies you that a new version is available, click
  "Close". Upgrading from within the application won't work.

- The first time you run musique, it scans your music collection and
  uses the Discogs service to get metadata about the files (meaning, it
  sends a list of all your music to a 3rd party). This isn't optional,
  so if you have privacy concerns about it, don't bother installing
  this software.
