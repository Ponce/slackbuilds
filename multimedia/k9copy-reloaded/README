K9copy-reloaded is a continuation of the original k9copy program.
It allows you to make 1:1 backups of both single-and dual-layer
DVDs, as well as compress a dual-layer DVD to single-layer.

NOTE 1: This script now uses the system ffmpeg, so be sure it is
installed before trying to run this script.

NOTE 2: K9copy-reloaded is unable to open .iso files on 32-bit systems.
This is an issue with libdvdread and not with k9copy-reloaded.
They open just fine on 64-bit systems.

NOTE 3: If you wish to build this on current (15.0 EXPERIMENTAL), you
will need to pass CURRENT=yes to the script.

NOTE 4: dvdauthor is listed as optional, but it is not necessary.
It crashes k9copy if you try to use it in current, but it works fine
in 14.2.  It is disabled by default in settings.

NOTE 5: This program is only intended for personal backups, and is NOT
intended for copying of copyrighted commercial DVDs.  Therefore, there 
is NO CSS decription libary included in this package.

Requires libmpeg2 and ffmpeg (ffmpeg is already included in current).
