K9copy-reloaded is a continuation of the original k9copy program.
It allows you to make 1:1 backups of both single-and dual-layer
DVDs, as well as compress a dual-layer DVD to single-layer.

NOTE 1: This script now uses the system ffmpeg, so be sure it is
installed before trying to run this script.

NOTE 2: This program is only intended for personal backups, and is NOT
intended for copying of copyrighted commercial DVDs.  Therefore, there 
is NO CSS decription libary included in this package.

NOTE 3: dvdauthor is listed as optional, but it crashes k9copy if you
try to use it for copy without menus; it is disabled by default in
settings.

Requires libmpeg2.
