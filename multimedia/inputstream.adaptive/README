InputStream Adaptive (inputstream.adaptive) is a binary kodi addon
that acts as a demuxer for segmented, multi-bitrate internet streams.
On Kodi, InputStream Adaptive serves as a client for adaptive streams
and can even play DRM content using an external library.

It is an essential component for many popular video addons including
Hummingbird, Netflix, YouTube, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video and SGK
Live-Portal.

NOTE: Many, if not all, players using inputstream.adaptive will
require downloading and installing the Widevine Content Decryption
Module (CDM). Widevine CDM is DRM licensing and encryption technology
that is owned and maintained by Google.

Kodi will prompt you to agree to download and install it the first
time Widevine CDM is requested for use.
