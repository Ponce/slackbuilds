XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing.  They work with 
TV listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea
is to separate out the back-end (getting the listings) from the front-end 
(displaying them for the user), and to implement useful operations like 
picking out your favorite programs as filters that read and write XML 
documents.

At present there are back-ends grabbing TV listings for Australia, Belgium 
and Luxembourg, Brazil, Argentina, Britain and Ireland, Croatia, Denmark, 
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary and Romania, Iceland, Italy, 
Japan, Netherlands, North America, Norway, Portugal, Reunion Island (France),
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.

This requires:
libwww-perl, perl-xml-twig, perl-Date-Manip, perl-XML-Writer,
perl-Lingua-Preferred, perl-TermReadKey, perl-Unicode-String,
perl-Term-ProgressBar, perl-File-Slurp, perl-xml-libxml,
perl-Lingua-EN-Numbers-Ordinate.

See README.SBo for optional requirements for grabbers.
