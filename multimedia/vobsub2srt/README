vobsub2srt  (convert VOBSUB subtitles to SRT)

VobSub2SRT is a simple command line program to convert .idx / .sub
subtitles into .srt text subtitles by using OCR.  It is based on code
from the MPlayer project.  Some minor parts are copied from
ffmpeg/avutil headers. Tesseract is used for OCR.

vobsub2srt is released under the GPL3+ license. The MPlayer code
included is GPL2+ licensed.

The quality of the OCR depends on the text in the subtitles.
Currently the code does not use any preprocessing.  But you can
correct any mistakes in the .srt files with any text editor.
