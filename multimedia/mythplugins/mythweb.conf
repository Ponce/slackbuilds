# Apache configuration directives for MythWeb.  Please read INSTALL for setup
# requirements and troubleshooting, along with the comments in this file.

# CHANGE THIS PATH TO MATCH YOUR MYTHWEB INSTALLATION DIRECTORY!  e.g.

    # I *strongly* urge you to turn on authentication for MythWeb.  It is disabled
    # by default because it requires you to set up your own password file.  Please
    # see the man page for htdigest and then configure the folowing four directives
    # to suit your authentication needs.
    #
    #    AuthType           Digest
    #    AuthName           "MythWeb"
    #    AuthUserFile       /etc/httpd/extra/mythweb-htdigest
    #    Require            valid-user
    #    BrowserMatch       "MSIE"      AuthDigestEnableQueryStringHack=On
    #    Order              allow,deny
    #    Satisfy            any
    #
    #  * If you're running Apache earlier than 2.2, you will need to use
    #    the AuthDigestFile command instead of AuthUserFile (3rd line above).

    # Some special instructions for the MythWeb controller files

        <Files mythweb.*>

        # Use the following environment settings to tell MythWeb where you want it to
        # look to connect to the database, the name of the database to connect to, and
        # the authentication info to use to connect.  The defaults will usually work
        # fine unless you've changed mythtv's mysql.txt file, or are running MythWeb on
        # a different server from your main backend.  Make sure you have mod_env enabled.
        #
            setenv db_server        "localhost"
            setenv db_name          "mythconverg"
            setenv db_login         "mythtv"
            setenv db_password      "mythtv"

        #
        # By default, MythWeb uses the hostname program to look up the hostname of the
        # machine it runs on.  If this reports incorrect data, or you run MythWeb on a
        # machine without the hostname program, set this to your current hostname.
        #
        #   setenv hostname         "my_mythbox"
        #

        # By default, php will always search the current directory for include files,
        # but if you wish to install these directories outside of the current path
        # (eg. for security reasons), set this variable to the directory that
        # contains the directories like languages and templates.  eg.
        #
        #   setenv include_path      "/srv/httpd/htdocs/mythweb"

        # If you want MythWeb to email php/database errors (and a backtrace) to you,
        # uncomment and set the email address below.
        #
        #   setenv error_email       "mythweb_errors@example.com"
        #

        # If your local file system is something other than UTF-8, set this variable
        # so that the music and video portions of MythWeb can provide proper links
        # to your downloadable files.
        #
        #   setenv fs_encoding       "ISO-8859-1"
