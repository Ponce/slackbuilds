Coriander is a full-featured graphical interface for controlling digital cameras
through the IEEE-1394 bus (i.e. FireWire or iLink). It can also record videos,
send images to an FTP site and convert videos to V4L streams. A live display is
provided as well. The program will work with any camera which is compatible with
the IIDC specifications (v1.04 or later): this includes most 1394 webcams and
many industrial and scientific cameras.

Optional dependencies: ftplib (FTP support)
