kdenlive (KDE Non Linear Video Editor)

Kdenlive is an intuitive and powerful non-linear multi-track video
editor which supports DV, AVCHD and HDV editing, using many of the latest
video technologies.

Currently under development and using the MLT video framework,
Kdenlive provides dual video monitors, a multi-track timeline and clip
list. Features include customizable layout support, basic effects and
transitions, in-program access to online resources from Freesound,
Archive.org, and Open Clip Art. Kdenlive also features integrated basic
DVD authoring capability.

If you do not have the KDE desktop installed, you will need at least:
kdelibs, kdebase

NOTE:
This requires recordmydesktop from Slackware's extra directory.
