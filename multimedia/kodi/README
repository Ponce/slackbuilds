NOTE:

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
If you are having issues with addons crashing, please ensure you're
upgraded to at least python3-3.9.14 or later from the patches/
directory on your favorite mirror. 3.9.12 and earlier had issues.

FINAL NOTE:
FFMPEG on 15.0 is too old to be used in kodi v21, so it is using an
internal version of 6.0.1. If you have FFMPEG v6+ installed (probably
mainly -current users), you can have kodi build against the system
version by passing FFMPEG=external when building. System versions of
FFMPEG may need to be recompiled to enable certain functionality like
AV1 after installing dav1d.
