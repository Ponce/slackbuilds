NOTE:

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
If you are having issues with addons crashing, please ensure you're
upgraded to at least python3-3.9.14 or later from the patches/
directory on your favorite mirror. 3.9.12 and earlier had issues.

FINAL NOTE:
FFMPEG on 15.0 is too old to be used in kodi v21, so it is using an
internal version of 6.1.2. If you have FFMPEG v6+ installed (probably
mainly -current users), you could have kodi build against the system
version by passing FFMPEG=external when building. System versions of
FFMPEG may need to be recompiled to enable certain functionality like
AV1 after installing dav1d.
Note that ATM ffmpeg 7.x in current is unsupported so you have to
rely on the internal version.
