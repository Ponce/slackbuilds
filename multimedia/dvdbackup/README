dvdbackup is a tool to backup video DVDs from the command line.
It has the advantages of being small, fast, and easy to use.

By default, dvdbackup reformats the DVD title by replacing the
underscores with spaces and converting to "Proper Case".
To turn this "feature" off and retain the original VOLUME_ID
formatting, pass CLOBBER="no" to the script.

To build on current (15.0 EXPERIMENTAL), pass CURRENT=yes to 
the script.

NOTE: Copyright laws vary from nation to nation, so bear in mind
that this program is only intended for personal backups.

libdvdcss is is an optional runtime dependency.
