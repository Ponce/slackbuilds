mtpfs (mount MS Media Transport Protocol devices as a filesystem)

MTPfs is a FUSE filesystem that supports reading and writing from any
MTP device, as supported by libmtp. MTPfs includes extra features such
as playlist and meta information support for MP3 players.

Quickstart:
- Ensure your user is in the "audio" group
- Create a directory to use as a mount point (e.g. "mkdir ~/mtp")
- Set media device to MTP mode, if necessary
- Plug media device into USB port
- Run mtpfs with the mount point as an argument (e.g. "mtpfs ~/mtp")
- See /usr/doc/mtpfs-*/README and "mtpfs --help" output for more information
