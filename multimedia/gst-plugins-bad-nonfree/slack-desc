# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: gst-plugins-bad-nonfree (encumbered set of GStreamer plugins)
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree:
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: wide use.
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree:
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: Since gst-plugins-bad-free is part of Slackware, this package only
gst-plugins-bad-nonfree: includes the plugins that are not already in gst-plugins-bad-free.
