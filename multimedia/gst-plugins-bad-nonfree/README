gst-plugins-bad-nonfree (encumbered set of GStreamer plugins)

GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par
compared to the rest. They might be close to being good quality,
but they're missing something - be it a good code review, some
documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual
wide use.

Since gst-plugins-bad-free is part of Slackware, this package only
includes the plugins that are not already in gst-plugins-bad-free.

This optionally depends on TiMidity++, aom, amrnb, amrwb, celt,
chromaprint, DirectFB, faac, faad2, flite, gsm, ladspa_sdk, libass,
libcdaudio, libdc1394, libdca, libfdk-aac, libkate, liblrdf, libmimic,
libmodplug, libmusicbrainz, libofa, libquicktime, libsrtp, lv2,
musepack-tools, rtmpdump, schroedinger, srt, soundtouch, swfdec,
xvidcore, and nvidia*driver. And probably a few more that we've
missed.

Note that if you have any version of the nvidia drivers installed
the script would autodetect them and will try to build its nvdec
support, requiring the presence on the system of cudatoolkit too: as
cudatoolkit is *huge*, cuda support is disabled by default but it can
be explicitly enabled passing the script the variable CUDA=yes
