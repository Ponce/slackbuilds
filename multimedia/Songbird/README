Songbird is a desktop media player mashed-up with the Web. Songbird is 
committed to playing the music you want, from the sites you want, on the 
devices you want, challenging the conventions of discovery, purchase, 
consumption and organization of music on the Internet.

Songbird is a player and a platform. Like Firefox, Songbird is an open 
source, Open Web project built on the Mozilla platform. Songbird provides 
a public playground for Web media mash-ups by providing developers with 
both desktop and Web APIs, developer resources and fostering Open Web 
media standards, to wit, an Open Media Web.

Note that this is a binary repackaging (much like mozilla-firefox) and 
not compiled from source.

Note: if songbird has problems reloading the media library after 
upgrading, or refuses to scan for media, backup and delete both
~/.songbird2 and ~/.gstreamer-10 directories.

Songbird is patched to not require GConf. If you want to use GConf, supply 
GCONF=yes on the commandline. (eg GCONF=yes ./Songbird.SlackBuild)

Songbird requires gst-plugins-good, gst-plugins-bad, and gst-plugins-ugly,
to work and play files. The build scripts for all of these are available
at SlackBuilds.org.
