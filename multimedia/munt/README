munt (Roland MIDI device emulator)

Munt is a multi-platform software synthesizer emulating (somewhat
inaccurately) pre-GM MIDI devices such as the Roland MT-32, CM-32L,
CM-64 and LAPC-1.

ROMS for these devices are not included.

This will install both the desktop application and the shared library.
