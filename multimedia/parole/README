Parole is a modern, simple media player based on the GStreamer framework
and written to fit well in the Xfce desktop. Parole features playback of
local media files, DVD/CD and live streams. Parole is extensible via
plugins.

The GStreamer framework provides a strong plugin interface to dynamically
load plugins that support certain media types, the more GStreamer plugins
you have installed in your system the more media formats you can play with
Parole.
