ripit (command line audio CD ripper)

RipIT is used to create MPEG-1 Layer 3 (mp3) using Lame, or uses Flac
(flac), Ogg Vorbis (ogg), Faac (m4a), Musepack (mpc), mp4als (als),
Wavpack (wv) or ffmpeg to convert audio files (wav) extracted from an
audio CD. It is a console based front-end (no GUI here), written in
Perl, for various programs which must be installed.

RipIT has *many* optional dependencies; see README_SBo.txt for details.

RipIT has a vast (some would say bewildering) array of command-line
and config file options. See its man page and the comments in
/etc/ripit/config for details.

The program will do the following without user intervention:

* get the audio CD Album/Artist/Tracks info from MusicBrainz or freeCDDB
* rip the audio CD Tracks
* encode to Flac, mp3, Ogg-Vorbis, mpc, m4a or als
* id3 tag encoded songs
* create a playlist (m3u) file
* optionally generate a toc or inf files for DAO burning with, CD-text
* optionally prepare and send a CDDB submission and save it locally
* optionally extract hidden songs and split ghost songs
* optionally create md5sum files for all tracks
* run several encoder processes at the same time and same run
