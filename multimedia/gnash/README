Gnash is the GNU SWF movie player, which can be run standalone on the
desktop or an embedded device, as well as a plugin for several browsers.

Plugins are now disabled by default due to browsers removing support.

Optional but recommended deps are gst0-ffmpeg and gst0-plugins-ugly.
Another optional dependency is qt4.
