Gnash is the GNU SWF movie player, which can be run standalone on the
desktop or an embedded device, as well as as a plugin for several browsers.

If you don't want to compile it or if you don't have KDE installed,
you can disable the Konqueror plugin ("Klash") like this:
	KLASH=no ./gnash.SlackBuild

Optional but recommended dependencies are speex, gst0-ffmpeg,
and gst0-plugins-ugly.
