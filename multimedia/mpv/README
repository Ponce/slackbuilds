mpv
===

mpv is a movie player based on MPlayer and mplayer2. It shares some features
with the former projects while introducing many more. It supports a wide
variety of video file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types.

optional: docutils, lua, libquvi, lirc, libbluray, libdvdnav, enca, ladspa_sdk,
          SDL2, jack-audio-connection-kit, OpenAL, wayland, vdpau, oss, libbs2b,
          portaudio, libfdk-acc

If docutils is not installed, the man pages will not be built/installed.
This is the reason I have included docutils in both the `required` and
`optional` lists. If you don't concider the man pages required, then the
docutils package is optional, too. Building the man pages is recommended.

Dependencies are autodetected. Some optional dependencies are disabled by
default and may be enabled (see BUILD_OPTS). Optional dependencies that are
enabled by default may be disabled (see BUILD_OPTS).

BUILD_OPTS:
To override the default for build options, set the shell variable BUILD_OPTS
prior to or at build time. For example, to enable cdda and openal, which are
disabled by default, and to build with four jobs in parallel, you could use the
following:

~# BUILD_OPTS="--enable-cdda --enable-openal --jobs=4" sh mpv.SlackBuild

or, if you use fakeroot to build packages:

~$ fakeroot env BUILD_OPTS="--enable-cdda --enable-openal" sh mpv.SlackBuild

The following list is meant as a note to myself of build options or optional
dependencies currently unavailable via full Slackware installation and from SBo:

vaapi, vapoursynth, libguess, libiconv, rsound
