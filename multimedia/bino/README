bino (3D video player)

Bino is a 3D video player with multi-display support.

3D videos are more accurately called stereoscopic videos. Such videos
have separate views for the left and right eyes and thus allow depth
perception through stereopsis.

The left and right view of a stereoscopic video can be stored using
different layouts. Bino supports all commonly used layouts.

Optional dependency: lirc for infra-red support. Autodetected, but
may be disabled with LIRC=no in the environment.
