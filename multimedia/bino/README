 bino (3D video player)

Bino is a 3D video player with multi-display support.

3D videos are more accurately called stereoscopic videos. Such videos 
have separate views for the left and right eye and thus allow depth 
perception through stereopsis.
The left and right view of a stereoscopic video can be stored using 
different layouts. Bino supports all commonly used layouts.

Requirements:
 - libGLEW with mx support

glew.SlackBuild fix:
----------------------------------------------------------
# patch wrong multiple definitions for compiling bino
patch -p1 < $CWD/glewexport.patch

make install.all GLEW_DEST=$PKG/usr || exit 1
----------------------------------------------------------

Notes: The glew-1.9.0 needs to be rebuild with install.all for install
libGLEWmx. For compiling bino with glew-1.9.0 is required a patch "glewexport.patch".
The glew-1.10.0 compiles without problems.
