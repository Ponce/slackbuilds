bino (3D video player)

Bino is a 3D video player with multi-display support.

3D videos are more accurately called stereoscopic videos. Such videos 
have separate views for the left and right eye and thus allow depth 
perception through stereopsis.
The left and right view of a stereoscopic video can be stored using 
different layouts. Bino supports all commonly used layouts.

NOTE:
This SlackBuild build with Qt4 even though the default from upstream
is Qt5. It's still broken at this moment.

Optional dependency: lirc for infra-red support.
You may need to edit the SlackBuild to enable lirc.
