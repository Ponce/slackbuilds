audacious (A relatively powerful media player)

Audacious is a media player, based on Beep Media Player, which is in
turn based on the X Multimedia System (XMMS).  It is used to play
audio and other kinds of media files.  By default Audacious can play
MPEG audio, Ogg Vorbis, RIFF wav, most module formats, and a few
other formats.  Audacious can be extended through plugins to play a
number of other audio and video formats.

Audacious needs the mcs library and the audacious-plugins, which
are available at SlackBuilds.org
