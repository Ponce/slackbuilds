DroidCam

DroidCam turns your phone/tablet into a webcam for your PC.
Use it with chat programs like Zoom, MS Teams, and Skype.

Main Features:
– Chat using “DroidCam Webcam” on your computer, including Sound and Picture.
– Connect over WiFi or USB cable.
– Unlimited free usage with standard definition.
– Keep using your phone while DroidCam is in background (Android).
– Simple, safe, efficient, and trusted by millions of people worldwide.

The GNU/Linux client is a combination an executable app that connects to 
the phone, and Video4Linux and ALSA loopback drivers.

It’s assumed you are somewhat familiar with the system and how to use the 
Terminal. Please keep in mind other posts on the site are Windows oriented.
