Avidemux is a free video editor designed for simple cutting, filtering and 
encoding tasks. It supports many file types, including AVI, DVD compatible 
MPEG files, MP4 and ASF, using a variety of codecs. Tasks can be automated 
using projects, job queue and powerful scripting capabilities.

By default only the cli and qt4 interfaces are built. Upstream currently
does not support the gtk interface and while it may build, the gtk gui
crashes during startup. To enable (or disable) an interface, use the
WITH_CLI, WITH_QT4, and WITH_GTK variables as such:

WITH_CLI=NO sh ./avidemux.SlackBuild

or, if you use fakeroot:

fakeroot env WITH_GTK=YES sh ./avidemux.SlackBuild

though building the gtk is not recommended or supported.

Optional dependencies are aften, amrnb, and jack-audio-connection-kit.
