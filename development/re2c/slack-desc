# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

re2c: re2c (regular expressions to C/C++ conversion tool)
re2c:
re2c: It is a tool for writing very fast and very flexible scanners. Unlike
re2c: any other such tool, re2c focuses on generating high efficient code
re2c: for regular expression matching. As a result this allows a much
re2c: broader range of use than any traditional lexer offers. And last but
re2c: not least re2c generates warning free code that is equal to
re2c: hand-written code in terms of size, speed and quality
