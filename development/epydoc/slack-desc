# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

epydoc: epydoc (python api documentation tool)
epydoc:
epydoc: Epydoc is a tool for generating API documentation for Python modules,
epydoc: based on their docstrings. For an example of epydoc's output, see
epydoc: the API documentation for epydoc itself (html, pdf). A lightweight
epydoc: markup language called epytext can be used to format docstrings,
epydoc: and to add information about specific fields, such as parameters and
epydoc: instance variables. Epydoc also understands docstrings written in
epydoc: reStructuredText, Javadoc, and plaintext.
