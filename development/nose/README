nose (a discovery-based unittest extension)

nose provides an alternate test discovery and running process for 
unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as 
much as is reasonably possible without resorting to too much magic.

NOTE: Building nose requires Python setuptools to be installed 
(available at SlackBuilds.org as "pysetuptools").  Also, Sphinx,
if installed, is used to generate the docs, but it is optional.
