nose provides an alternate test discovery and running process for
unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as
much as is reasonably possible without resorting to too much magic.

NOTE: Building nose requires requires pysetuptools, and Sphinx is 
optional if you want more docs.
