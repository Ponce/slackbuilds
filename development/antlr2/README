ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser
generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating
structured text or binary files.

Optional dependencies are jdk/openjdk8/zulu-openjdk8 and mono (to
enable Java and C# support). C++ and Python are enabled by
default.

It is safe to install alongside libantlr3c.
