# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cppcheck: Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code. Unlike C/C++
cppcheck: compilers and many other analysis tools, it doesn't detect syntax
cppcheck: errors. Cppcheck only detects the types of bugs that the compilers
cppcheck: normally fail to detect. The goal is no false positives.
