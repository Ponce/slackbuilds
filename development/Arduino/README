The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload
it to the board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment
is written in Java and based on Processing and other open-source software.
This software can be used with any Arduino board.

NOTE: This script compiles everything from the source. Compared to the binary
version, it will take longer and require almost 1GB of free space.
