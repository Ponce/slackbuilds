kconfig-frontends project aims at centralising the effort of keeping an
up-to-date, out of the Linux source tree, packaging of the kconfig
infrastructure, ready for use by third party projects.

The configuration language used by the Linux kernel, known as kconfig,
has gained some traction in the community, due to its advantages:
 * simple syntax and grammar
 * limited, yet adequate, option types: boolean and tristates, integers and
   strings
 * simple, yet efficient, organisation of options: indentation, sub-menus,
   radio-like choices
 * direct and reverse dependencies
