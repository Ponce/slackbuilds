# 20211224 bkw: BUILD=2, fix for -current (add old openssl lib).
# 20200326 bkw: update for v1.12 for 64-bit, stay at 1.10 for 32-bit.
# 20200317 bkw: update for v1.10, switched from RPM to .deb. Yes, there
# is a v1.11 available, but there are good reasons for not packaging it,
# from our POV:
# 1) v1.11 dropped support for 32-bit.
# 2) The 64-bit .deb for v1.11 is missing one of the shared libraries that
#    should be packaged with it, so it doesn't *work*. Reported to
#    upstream, possibly will be fixed soon.

# 20211224 bkw: upstream's QtNetwork library was built with
# openssl-1.0.x. It won't work with openssl-1.1.x, and hexinator
# won't work with Slackware's qt5. Since PV dropped openssl10-solibs,
# we have to include the shared lib in this package. Before you
# start freaking out about how insecure and unmaintained this old
# openssl is, remember that it's *only* used by hexinator (lives in
# /opt/hexinator), and that hexinator only uses it to talk to its own
# vendor's server. So long as you trust the vendor, it's OK. And if
# you don't, you wouldn't run their precompiled binary anyway, right?

# The hexinator binary was built with rpath support, so it can find its
# own libraries. The libs need some attention before hexinator can find
# them (presumably dpkg would automagically do this when the package gets
# installed). It's a qt5 app that ships with its own private set of qt5
# libs. We *don't* want it using any other qt5 libs that may happen to
# exist (like the ones in /usr/lib64 from the qt5 SlackBuild). The
# ldconfig step here prevents that.
