Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers,
it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external
assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.
TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions,
including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is
distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

In order to have cross compiler support, pass CROSS=yes to the script.
