# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

tcc: tcc (Tiny C Compiler)
tcc:
tcc: Tiny C Compiler is a very fast C compiler. Unlike other C compilers,
tcc: it is meant to be self-relying: you do not need an external
tcc: assembler or linker because TCC does that for you.
tcc: TCC supports ANSI C and most of ISO C99 and many GNUC extensions,
tcc: including inline assembly. tcc was written by Fabrice Bellard and is
tcc: distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.
