Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions.

Guile is an interpreter for Scheme, packaged as a library that you
can link into your applications to give them their own scripting
language. Guile will eventually support other languages as well,
giving users of Guile-based applications a choice of languages.

This is Guile 2.0 (legacy version) needed by some packages in SBo.
Heavily based on Guile 1.8 and 2.2 SlackBuilds, also found on SBo.

This package can be installed alongside with Slackware's Guile
