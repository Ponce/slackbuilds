P4V, the Perforce Visual Client, provides quick and easy access to
versioned files through a graphical interface that is consistent across
multiple operating systems.

P4V represents the files in a project in the same file/folder hierarchy
employed by the native operating system. File state information
indicates which file versions are currently on the user's workstation
and on the Perforce Server.
