autogen generates program files from repetitive text with varied
substitutions.  Its goal is to simplify the maintenance of programs
that contain large amounts of repetitive text.  This is especially
valuable if there are several blocks of such text that must be kept
synchronized in parallel tables.

Note:
- autogen will not build if autogen1.8 is present in your system.
