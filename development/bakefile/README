Bakefile is cross-platform, cross-compiler native makefiles generator.
It takes compiler-independent description of build tasks as input and
generates native makefile (autoconf's Makefile.in, Visual C++ project,
bcc makefile etc.).

Bakefile's task is to generate native makefiles, so that people can
keep using their favorite tools. There are other cross-platform make
solutions, but they either aren't native and require the user to use
unfamiliar tools (Boost.Build) or they are too limited (qmake).
