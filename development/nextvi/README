Nextvi is a fork of neatvi, a simple and clean vi(1) implementation, by
one of the suckless developers. In addition to code refactoring it
provides a handful of user contributed patches that can extend the
editors capabilities. (reminiscent of dwm's patches) 

By default no patches are applied, to add a patch from
https://github.com/kyx0r/nextvi/tree/patches, extract the SlackBuild 
and create a directory called patches. Any patches saved here will be 
applied in the build. To add arrow key navigation in normal mode for 
instance, put the arrowkeys_normal.patch in the patches directory. 
Shell scripts are not handled by this SlackBuild.
