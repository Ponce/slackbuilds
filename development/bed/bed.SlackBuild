# I found the startup message confusing, it says "Alt-X to open menu",

# The TOBUILD* stuff below is because we said

# $ARCH-slackware-linux-cc in $PATH, which there ain't. If we were
# cross-compiling, this would have to be solved some other way.

# Replace .desktop file with cleaned-up version that passes

# with bed, so I'm leaving that as-is. The desktop menu specification
# doesn't have a HexEditor or even a generic Editor category (which IMO
# is a symptom of how broken the thinking behind the specification is),
# so I had to pick between the generic System and slightly-less-generic
# Development categories...

# The rxvt stuff (rxvt.plug) doesn't get built by this script. The build
# process is too horrendous and baroque for me to spend more time trying
# to understand why. The default config file tries to load rxvt.plug and
# shows a scary but harmless "rxvt.plug: cannot open shared object file"
# error on startup, so I'm just going to disable it in the config.

# In case you're wondering, the editor's fully functional without the
# plugin. What it actually does is allows you to adjust the terminal
# bed is running in (the font size, set reverse video, and disable the
# scrollbar) from within bed. Most (all?) terminals already supply their
# own ways to do these things, so this is really extra fluff.
