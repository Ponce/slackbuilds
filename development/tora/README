accessing most of the common database platforms in use, including Oracle, MySQL,
and Postgres, as well as limited support for any target that can be accessed
through Qt's ODBC support.

For Oracle DBMS support, run the script like this,
  ORACLE_HOME=/path/to/oracle/home ./tora.Slackbuild

postgresql is an autodetected dependency.
