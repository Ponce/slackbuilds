TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on
javascript giving you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript adds
optional types to JavaScript  that support tools for large-scale
JavaScript applications for any browser,for any host, on any OS.
TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

This needs to be rebuit after a major or minor
nodejs upgrade

NOTE: This script requires network access during build process.
