# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jsmin: JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace
jsmin: from JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half,

jsmin: programming style because it eliminates the download cost of clean,
jsmin: literate self-documentation.
