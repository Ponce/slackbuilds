JSMin, The JavaScript Minifier

JSMin is a filter that removes comments and unnecessary whitespace from
JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half, resulting in faster
downloads. It also encourages a more expressive programming style because it
eliminates the download cost of clean, literate self-documentation.
