Eclipse - An open-source, platform-independent software framework.

Eclipse is an open source community whose projects are focused on building an 
open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools, and 
runtimes for building, deploying, and managing software across the lifecycle.

If you get an error when trying to start eclipse (from the command line) or 
trying to use its internal web browser (which depends on xulrunner), please
