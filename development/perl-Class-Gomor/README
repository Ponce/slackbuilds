Class::Gomor - another class and object builder

This module is yet another class builder. This one adds parameter checking in
new constructor, that is to check for attributes existence, and definedness.
In order to validate parameters, the module needs to find attributes, and that
is the reason for declaring attributes in global variables named @AS, @AA,
@AO. They respectively state for Attributes Scalar, Attributes Array and
Attributes Other. The last one is used to avoid autocreation of accessors,
that is to let you declare your own ones.
Attribute validation is performed by looking at classes hierarchy, by
following @ISA tree inheritance.
The loss in speed by validating all attributes is quite negligeable on a
decent machine (Pentium IV, 2.4 GHz) with Perl 5.8.x. But if you want to avoid
checking, you can do it.
