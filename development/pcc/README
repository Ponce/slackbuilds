pcc (Portable C Compiler) is based on the original Portable C Compiler
by S. C. Johnson, written in the late 70's. About 50% of the frontend
code and 80% of the backend code has been rewritten.

Build options (environment variables):
TLS - Enable thread local storage? Default=no, export TLS=yes to enable.
CC - Compiler to use. Default is to look for pcc, gcc, clang (in that order).

This build is for the 1.1.0 release of pcc. The 1.0 release no longer
works on modern Slackware versions (newer than 13.37). The old pcc
1.0 had separate builds for pcc and pcc-libs; this build includes the
libraries so no separate pcc-libs is needed (or exists).

Optional step: To bootstrap pcc, first remove any old versions of pcc
(and pcc-libs, if present), then build and install pcc twice (without
setting CC). The first time, pcc will be built with gcc. The second time,
it will be built with itself.

Note: pcc is a C compiler only. There is experimental, incomplete support
for C++ and Fortran 77 in the pcc codebase, but neither is usable yet.
