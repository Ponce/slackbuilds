pcc (Portable C Compiler)

pcc is based on the original Portable C Compiler by S. C. Johnson,
written in the late 1970s. About 50% of the frontend code and 80% of
the backend code has been rewritten.

Build options (environment variables):

TLS - Enable thread local storage? Default=no, export TLS=yes to enable.
CC - Compiler to use. Default: look for pcc and clang (in that order).
     It's no longer possible to use CC=gcc.

Notes:

1. To bootstrap pcc, first remove any old versions of pcc
   (and pcc-libs, if present), then build and install pcc twice
   (without setting CC). The first time, pcc will be built with
   clang. The second time, it will be built with itself.

2. This build is for a post-1.1.0 snapshot of pcc. The 1.0 release no
   longer works on modern Slackware versions (newer than 13.37), and
   the 1.1.0 release no longer works on Slackware 15.0. The old pcc
   1.0 had separate builds for pcc and pcc-libs; this build includes
   the libraries so no separate pcc-libs is needed (or exists).

3. pcc is a C compiler only. There is experimental, incomplete
   support for C++ and Fortran 77 in the pcc codebase, but neither is
   usable yet.
