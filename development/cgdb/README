CGDB is a curses (terminal-based) interface to the GNU Debugger
(GDB). Its goal is to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered
with unnecessary features.

The primary feature of CGDB is the constant presence of a source
display, updated as the program executes, to help keep you focused
while debugging.  The interface is inspired by the classic Unix text
editor, vi. Those familiar with vi (or vim) should feel right at home
using CGDB.
