README for SlackBuilds.org development/obcpl examples
-----------------------------------------------------

This directory contains simple example programs written in BCPL.

hello.b: The canonical Hello World program.
Original source: https://github.com/leachim6/hello-world/

factorial.b: Calculates the factorials of the integers 1 through 5.
Original source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL

If you want to mess with this directory, it's best to copy it to your
user's home directory (so you don't have to compile the programs as
root). You can compile hello and factorial just by running "make".
