NumPy is a general-purpose array-processing package designed to
efficiently manipulate large multi-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
records without sacrificing too much speed for small multi-dimensional
arrays.  NumPy is built on the Numeric code base and adds features
introduced by numarray as well as an extended C-API and the ability to
create arrays of arbitrary type which also makes NumPy suitable for
interfacing with general-purpose data-base applications.

There are also basic facilities for discrete fourier transform, basic
linear algebra and random number generation.

If you need to build numpy for debugging, set DEBUG=y. If software
depending on numpy is having problems with the new relaxed strides
checking, set NPY_RSC=0.

It is highly recommended to install optimized BLAS and LAPACK libs
before installing numpy. You may choose between ATLAS+LAPACK and
OpenBLAS.

IMPORTANT: The version installed by this SlackBuild does NOT include the
           oldnumeric and numarray compatibility modules since starting with
           version 1.9.0 these modules got removed by the numpy developers.
           If you need these compatibility modules please consider the
           numpy-legacy SlackBuild.
           THUS: This SlackBuild conflicts with the numpy-legacy SlackBuild
                 which installs versions < 1.9.0!

This numpy3 SlackBuild creates bindings for python3 and can be installed
without conflict alongside the standard numpy SlackBuild.
