# TODO: someday include the zsdcc stuff. Probably sometime after z88dk's
# 2.0 release. If no 2.0 release exists by, say, the start of 2019, I'll
# probably change this build so it works with a git snapshot instead
# of a release. I'll admit, my motivation for that will be that I want
# to have a C compiler that targets Pac-Man arcade hardware (the 1.99B
# release doesn't, current git does).

# actually installed to share, if I don't do this:
sed -i '/^prefix_share/s,/share,/lib,' Makefile

# Note to well-intentioned maintainers: please don't try to move
# this stuff to /usr/lib64 on 64-bit systems. There's no native code
# (no ELF executables, no shared or static libraries full of x86_64
# code). Everthing in /usr/lib/z88dk is either headers, source, or
# z88dk's own .lib format for z80 object code. From Linux's point
# of view, it's just data. It's no different from Pat keeping udev
# rules in /lib/udev on 64-bit.

# Parallel make of the compiler itself works OK, but not of the
# z80 native libraries.
