Sublime Text 3 is a sophisticated text editor for code, html and prose.
You'll love the slick user interface and extraordinary features.

Sublime Text 3 is still in beta (version 2 is the stable release) and
may be downloaded and evaluated for free; however, a license must be
purchased for continued use.  There is currently no enforced time
limit for the evaluation.
