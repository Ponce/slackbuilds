cargo - The Rust package manager https://crates.io/

This will build cargo from source, which like rust, requires itself to
bootstrap. This will build cargo using the installed rust and previously stable
version of cargo.

If you already have cargo installed, this slackbuild will use it to
bootstrap this version of cargo instead of a downloaded one.

You can also force either behaviour through the LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=yes|no
parameter.

  LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=no ./cargo.SlackBuild

By default, the slackbuild requires all crate dependencies to be downloaded
individually. Optionally, if you have cargo-vendor installed, you can create
a "vendored" tarball which contains all the crate dependencies exploded into a
single directory and then compressed together as a tarball.

The script cargo-mkvendortarball.sh will generate this for you. The slackbuild
will automatically use this tarball if found in the current directory.
