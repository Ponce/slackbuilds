protobuf3 (Google's data interchange format)

Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
serializing structured data.

This package contains protobuf API version 3.
It support the following language implementations:
* C++
* Java
* Python
* Objective-C
* C#
* JavaNano
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* Go
* PHP (Alpha)

The complete documentation for Protocol Buffers is available at:
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

Notes: 
* The protobuf build (API version 2) has been removed from
  SlackBuilds.org, because nothing uses it any longer and it
  conflicted with this build.
* Protobuf3 enforces strict UTF-8 checking.
  Parsing will fail if a string field contains non UTF-8 data.
