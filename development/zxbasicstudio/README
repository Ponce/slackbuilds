ZX Basic Studio is a project initially created by Dr. Gusman
whose original code and earlier versions can be found at
https://github.com/gusmanb/ZXBasicStudio. ZX Basic Studio
is a cross-platform IDE for the Boriel Basic compiler

This is a work in progress but the development has reached
a state in which we feel comfortable to release it to be
tested by users. Expect bugs as this is a development build.
