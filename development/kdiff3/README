    * shows the differences line by line and character by character (!),
    * provides an automatic merge-facility and
    * an integrated editor for comfortable solving of merge-conflicts,
    * supports Unicode, UTF-8 and other codecs, autodetection via 
      byte-order-mark "BOM"
    * supports KIO on KDE (allows accessing ftp, sftp, fish, smb etc.),
    * Printing of differences,
    * Manual alignment of lines,
    * Automatic merging of version control history ($Log$),
    * and has an intuitive graphical user interface.
    * Windows-Explorer integration Diff-Ext-for-KDiff3 - shell
      extension included in installer (originally by Sergey Zorin;
      see also Diff Ext)
    * Read what else is special in a short abstract (PDF).


NOTE: By default, a KDE version is compiled. If you prefer a Qt4-only
version, pass the script QT4ONLY=yes, like:

QT4ONLY=yes ./kdiff3.SlackBuild
