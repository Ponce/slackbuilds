Net::Libdnet - binding for Dug Song's libdnet

Net::Libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level
networking routines, including network address manipulation, kernel arp cache
and route table lookup and manipulation, network firewalling, network
interface lookup and manipulation, network traffic interception via tunnel
interfaces, and raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission. It is intended
to complement the functionality provided by libpcap.

This package requires perl-Class-Gomor and libdnet, from SlackBuilds.org
