"paramiko" is a combination of the esperanto words for "paranoid"
and "friend". it's a module for python 2.2+ that implements the
SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections
to remote machines. Unlike SSL (aka TLS), SSH2 protocol does not
require heirarchical certificates signed by a powerful central
authority.

paramiko requires pycrypto, also available from Slackbuilds.org
