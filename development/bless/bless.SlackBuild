# 32-bit and 64-bit packages, even though the actual object code is
# noarch. Also, no CFLAGS because, no C... since I'm not a mono/C#
# expert, I dunno what the equivalent optimization flags should be
# (or if they even exist) so we'll go with whatever upstream does.

# Begin rant. FWIW, I'm not very impressed with bless:
# - It has show-stopper bugs that were left in place when the maintainer
#   abandoned it a few years ago (others have fixed the worst of them
#   by now, patches included here).
# - It starts up in Insert mode which definitely violates the principle
#   of least surprise (in normal hex editors, overwrite is generally the
#   default and often only mode). This is so annoying that I patched it.
#   Even in overwrite mode, it'll let you append bytes to the end of
#   the file, which a hex editor shouldn't do in its default mode.
# - It ships with 3 .layout files that get installed in /usr/share, but
#   the layout dialog is broken: you can't choose between the
#   "system" layouts, though you can load them if you copy them to
#   ~/.config/bless/layouts. (But, they don't appear to *do* anything...)
# - Finally, and maybe this is just my own personal bias, I don't see an
#   obvious way to change the white background to black (if the .layout
#   files are capable of it, great, but I tried really hard to get them
#   to work and they don't seem to behave the way the docs say they do).
#   This means I won't be using this application very much, as it hurts
#   my eyes to look at it for more than a few minutes.
# If it's so awful, why am I writing a SlackBuild for it? Because it's
# a GUI hex editor that (a) uses GTK, and (b) doesn't require KDE and
# its horde of daemons. Someone is going to be glad it's here. People
# who grew up using GUIs are going to prefer this to a textmode app.
# Here endeth the rant.

# Patch from Debian. Might not be needed with newer versions of mono,
# but no harm done.

# Make bless act like all other hex editors on the planet by NOT starting
# up in Insert mode. I wouldn't have patched this, except that bless
# doesn't auto-save the Insert/Overwrite state across sessions. You can
# set the default via Edit/Preferences, but it doesn't remember the last
# state if you just press Insert to toggle it.
