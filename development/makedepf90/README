Makedepf90 is a program for automatic creation of Makefile-style dependency
lists for Fortran source code. Makedepf90 supports MODULE:s, INCLUDE:s, cpp
#include:s, f90ppr $include:s and coco ??include:s and set-files.

Also included is a patch which adds the '-B PATH' option to mirror the source
directory structure in PATH. This patch has been submitted to the current
makedepf90 maintainer Alastair McKinstry <mckinstry@debian.org> for inclusion in
future upstream releases.

To build the patched version, do this:

  "PATCH=yes ./makedepf90.SlackBuild"
