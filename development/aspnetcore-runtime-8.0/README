.NET is an open-source, general-purpose development platform
maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub.
It's cross-platform (supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux)
and can be used to build device, cloud, and IoT applications.

This package contains everything you need to run a ASP.NET 8.0
application.
It includes ASP.NET Core 8.0 runtime and .NET 8.0 runtime.
If you want to build apps, install .NET 8.0 SDK (dotnet-sdk-8.0),
which contains these runtimes too.
