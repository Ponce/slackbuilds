OpenJDK 7 is an open source implementation of version 7 of the
Java Development Kit, Standard Edition.  It includes tools for
developing, testing, and running programs written in Java.

This build requires both apache-ant and gcc5.  You do NOT need to
install Oracle's jdk, as apache-ant will work just fine with the jvm
tools in gcc5.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout/login to your
machine as it will add new files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

This script may take a couple of hours to complete and will require
about 9 GB of disk space for its temporary directory.  It defaults to
"/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./openjdk7.SlackBuild

The 'cacerts' binary is a keystore containing CA certificates which
are used by Java applications.  It is taken from the CentOS package
'ca-certificates-2015.2.4-65.0.1.el6_6.noarch.rpm'.
