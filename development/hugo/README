Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go. It is
optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability. Hugo takes a
directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML
website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata, and you
can run Hugo from any directory. This works well for shared hosts and
other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a
second. A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in
around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs,
tumbles, and docs.

Notes:
This slackbuild installs the "extended" version of Hugo. Please see
the Hugo website for more about the additional functionality.

Current release:
Hugo cannot be updated beyond 0.148.2 in the current stable release
of Slackware.
