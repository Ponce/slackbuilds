Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Cargo - the Rust package manager - is included in this build.

This script may take a while to complete (just over an hour for x86_64, around
1 hour 45 minutes for x86 - both on a 10 core machine) and will require about
6.6GB (x86_64) / 7.1GB (x86) of disk space for its temporary directory. It
defaults to "/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./rust.SlackBuild

This will build rust from source, which requires using the "official" stage0
compiler for the version being built from rust-lang.org, which is currently
the previous stable version.

If you already have rust installed, this slackbuild will use it to bootstrap
itself.

You can also force either behaviour through the LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=yes|no
parameter.

  LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=no ./rust.SlackBuild
