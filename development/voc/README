voc -- Vishap Oberon Compiler.

Vishap Oberon's frontend and C backend engine
is a fork of Josef Templ’s Ofront, which has been
released under the FreeBSD License. Unlike Ofront,
Vishap Oberon does not include the Oberon v4
GUI environment.

Voc will be installed to /opt/voc. You will
need to add /opt/voc/bin to your $PATH.
