OpenJDK is an open source implementation of the Java(TM) 2 Platform Standard
Edition Development Kit. This package is built with the IcedTea build
project and includes tools for developing, testing, and running
programs written in Java.

apache-ant is a required dependency and you have to install it before
you build openjdk. However, you do not need to install Oracle's jdk,
since it's only a runtime dependency.

This script imports the security certificates also found in Oracle's
jdk. You can override this behavior by invoking the script like this:

KEYSTORE_NO_IMPORT=YES ./openjdk.SlackBuild

The above line, however, will cause some programs to fail to estab-
lish secure connections.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout/reboot your machine
as it will add new files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

This script may take a couple of hours to finish and will require
about 11 GB of disk space for its temporary directory. It defaults to
"/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./openjdk.SlackBuild

If you get an error like

Internal compiler error: java.lang.NullPointerException at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ReadManager.run(ReadManager.java:166)

simply run the build again. This happens early so it shouldn't be that of a
problem.  At least 1 out of 5 runs so far have always succeded.
