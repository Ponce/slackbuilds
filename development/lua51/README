lua51 (embeddable scripting language; older version)

Lua is a free software light-weight programming language designed
for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a
general-purpose, stand-alone scripting language.

This package is for version 5.1.x of lua, the one compatible
with the software that needs lua51 on slackbuilds.org. It won't
conflict with the regular lua package.
