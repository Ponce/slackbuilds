Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment
for Google's Android operating system, built on JetBrains' IntelliJ
IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It
is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating
systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools
as primary IDE for native Android application development.

This package used to require JDK, but now android-studio seems to be
shipping one.

NOTE2:

Android-Studio is a rare example of a "multilib-required" build.
From the website: 
https://developer.android.com/studio/install#64bit-libs

Namely, it needs:
 libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
