Fossil is a distributed version control and bug tracking system created by
D. Richard Hipp, primary author of SQLite.  Fossil embeds a web server which
provides a graphical interface for developers, administrators, and end users.
Features: tamper-resistant immutable artifact record, simple command-line
interface, coherent versioning across all files, easy branching and merging,
bisect searches, full-text documentation searches, customizable web interface,
online activity reports, built-in wiki, SHA3-256 and hardened SHA1 checksums,
FUSE filesystem, and automated replication and backup.  Fossil can host the
entire project development website, including the download area, but it also can
be used for individual projects with no need for a server.  An interesting
application is coordination of /etc and other system configuration files across
a network of computers.  Content is stored in an SQLite database for atomicity,
durability, and easy administration.
