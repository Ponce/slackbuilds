tkcon is a replacement for the standard console that comes with Tk.
The console itself provides many more features than the standard
console and works on all platforms where Tcl/Tk is available. It is
meant primarily to aid one when working with the little details inside
tcl and tk, giving Unix users the GUI console provided by default in the
Mac and Windows Tk.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:
* tcllib:  if installed, generate man pages.
