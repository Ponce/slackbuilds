Icecream is a distributed compile system. It allows parallel compiling
by distributing the compile jobs to several nodes of a compile network
running the icecc daemon. The icecc scheduler routes the jobs and
provides status and statistics information to the icecc monitor. Each
compile node can accept one or more compile jobs depending on the
number of processors and the settings of the daemon. Link jobs and
other jobs which cannot be distributed are executed locally on the
node where the compilation is started.

Note that upon installation of the resulting package, all your
software will be compiled by icecream by default.
