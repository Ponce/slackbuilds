# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

global: global - source code tagging system
global:
global: GNU GLOBAL is a source code tagging system that works the same way
global: across diverse environments (emacs, vi, less, bash, web browser, etc).
global: You can locate objects in source files and move there easily.
global: It is useful for hacking a large project containing many subdirectories,
global: many #ifdef and many main() functions. It is similar to ctags or etags
global: but is different from them at the point of independence of any editor.
global: It runs on a UNIX(POSIX) compatible operating system like GNU and BSD.
