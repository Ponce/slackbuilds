bas55 (ECMA-55 Minimal BASIC System)

bas55 is an implementation of the the Minimal BASIC programming
language as defined by the ECMA 55 standard.  It provides an
interpreter and an editor with line renumbering capabilities.

For enhanced editing support, pass LIBEDIT=yes to the SlackBuild. This
requires "libedit".
