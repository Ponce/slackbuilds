Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter. The line numbers are
mandatory, and it has PEEK & POKE. The main goal is to execute
programs written in old interpreters, even those that use peculiar
control flow constructs or automodifiable code. However, it can be
used as a scripting language, and has some not-so-classic
instructions. It has graphics modes that are compatible with some
classic systems and user defined.
