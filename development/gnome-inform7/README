Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural
language.  It is a radical reinvention of the way interactive fiction
is designed, guided by contemporary work in semantics and by the
practical experience of some of the world's best known writers of IF.

This includes both the "gnome-inform7" IDE and the "i7" command-line
shell.

For the dependencies, gst-plugins-bad needs to be built with libmodplug
support.
