Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural language.
It is a radical reinvention of the way interactive fiction is designed, guided
by contemporary work in semantics and by the practical experience of some of
the world's best known writers of IF.

This includes both the "gnome-inform7" IDE and the "i7" command-line shell.

For the dependencies, gst-plugins-bad needs to be built with libmodplug
support.
