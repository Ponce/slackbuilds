This is a plugin for setuptools that enables Git integration.  Once
installed, setuptools can be told to include in a module
distribution all the files tracked by git.  This is an alternative
to explicit inclusion specifications with MANIFEST.in.

This package was formerly known as gitlsfiles.  The name change is
the result of an effort by the setuptools plugin developers to
provide a uniform naming convention.

This requires pysetuptools.
