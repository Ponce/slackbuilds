xvi (tiny but full-featured vi clone)

Xvi is a portable multi-window version of the UNIX editor 'vi', derived
from "STEVIE" in the 1980s. The program was originally developed for the
Atari ST, but has been ported to many platforms. In spite of its name,
there is, as yet, no X-Windows-specific version of it.

It uses text windows separated by horizontal status lines on character
mode displays and the windows may represent different files being
edited, or different views on to the same file.

Two environment variables are supported:

  OPT=-O2     - Build with regular optimization level (default is -Os).
  STATIC=yes  - Build the xvi binary statically linked.

See README_SBo.txt for more details.
