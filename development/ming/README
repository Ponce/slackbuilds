Ming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP,
Perl, Ruby, Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way.
It comprises a lot of Flash functionality, including features
of Flash 6. Specifically, it lets you create: shapes (including
morphs), text, sprites (aka movie clips), buttons, and actions
in flash movies, plus more. The goal for Ming is to abstract
away all of the mundane specifics of the SWF file format.

This builds the c++, perl, python, php and tcl-plugin.
To enable the php extension, go to /etc/php/ming.ini
and uncomment the line:
  ; extension=ming.so
