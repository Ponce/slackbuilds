  Welcome to MinForth V3.4

----------------------------------------------------------------------

MinForth V3.4 is a classic Forth compiler in C and Forth. Development
resource requirements are minimal, hence the name MinForth. A text
editor and a C compiler are sufficient; by design no toolchain is
required to adapt or rebuild MinForth. A complete rebuild takes only
few seconds.

Some features:
- Windows or Linux (or DOS) versions build from the same source
- 64-bit or 32-bit versions build from the same source
- 128-bit double integer numbers (in 64-bit versions)
- complex numbers
- comfortable locals for all number types and with output locals
- NEW arbitrary length floating-point numbers
- turnkey applications with overlays
- comfortable block-file screen editor.

MinForth comprises a Forth-to-C transpiler to generate C code from
word or function definitions in mixed Forth and/or C language.
Transpiled code can be compiled by many modern C99 compilers to fast
and compact executable
application programs. Main but not exclusive application for the
transpiler is to build the MinForth V3.4 Forth compiler.

MinForth V3.4 is widely conformant to the Forth-2012 draft standard
(see enclosed file forth-2012.pdf) including all wordsets
(but for xchars).
It passes the standard test suite (and more), but it is still
'in beta'. Feedback and bug reports are welcome by
- posting in the old Usenet forum comp.lang.forth
- email to minforth@gmx.net

MinForth V3.4 is free software under an MIT license per enclosed file
mflicense.txt.

Have fun and stay healthy!
