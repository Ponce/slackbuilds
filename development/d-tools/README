This package provides ancillary tools for the D programming language
compiler.

The following tools are included:

* dub - Package manager for D packages.
* ddemangle - D symbol demangler.
* rdmd - D build tool.
* dustmite - Test case minimization tool.
* D-Scanner - Swiss-army knife for D source code.
* DCD - Auto-complete program.

By default DMD is used to build all tools but you can build them with
GDC as well. DMD is not required in this case. Specify $DC variable
for that: DC=gdc ./d-tools.SlackBuild
