Valkyrie is an open-source graphical user interface for Valgrind.  
Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library and is based on Valgrind`s XML 
output capabilities.  Valkyrie is designed for simplicity and ease 
of use while allowing access to the full range of Valgrind command
line options.  Currently, Valkyrie only supports Memcheck, although 
work is in progress to handle Cachegrind and Massif.

Also included in Valkyrie is an auxiliary tool which can read XML 
outputs from multiple Valgrind (Memcheck) runs, merge them into a 
single XML file, and optionally display the merged result in the GUI.

This requires valgrind.
