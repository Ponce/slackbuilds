# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ftjam:
ftjam: Jam recursively builds target files from source files, using
ftjam: dependency information and updating actions expressed in the Jambase
ftjam: file, which is written in jam's own interpreted language.  The default
ftjam: Jambase is compiled into jam and provides a boilerplate for common
ftjam: use, relying on a user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual
ftjam: targets and sources.
