Zed is a fully offline-capable, open source, keyboard-focused, text and code editor for power users.
You can use Zed to edit local files as well as remote files on any server.

Zed has all features you'd expect from a capable code editor:
- Syntax highlighting for many programming languages (e.g. C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, Dart,
  Erlang, Go, Haml, Haskell, HTML, ini files, Java, JavaScript, JSON, LogiQL, Lua, Markdown, Nix,
  PHP, Plist, Protobufs, Python, Ruby, Shell, XML)
- Code completion: symbols, snippets and property/method completion.
- Built-in linting for some languages with inline markers (JavaScript, CoffeeScript, JSON, Lua, CSS)
- Multiple cursors
- Split-view editing
- Themes: light and dark themes out of the box and you can easily develop your own using CSS.
