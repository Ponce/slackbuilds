Fennel is a programming language that brings together the speed,
simplicity, and reach of Lua with the flexibility of a lisp syntax and
macro system.

* Full Lua compatibilty: Easily call any Lua function or library from
  Fennel and vice-versa.
* Zero overhead: Compiled code should be just as or more efficient
  than hand-written Lua.
* Compile-time macros: Ship compiled code with no runtime dependency
  on Fennel.
* Embeddable: Fennel is a one-file library as well as an
* executable. Embed it in other programs to support runtime
* extensibility and interactive development.

Anywhere you can run Lua code, you can run Fennel code.

This require one version of Lua installed (lua, lua52, lua53, luajit):
Default support for all versions of Lua installed before build.
To specify which Lua versions:
  export LUAVER="vers"

"vers" must be one or more of "5.1 5.2 5.3 jit" in the right order
separated with space.

After installation there are one or more fennel executable files for the
equivalent versions of Lua.

To install compiled binary versions (experimental, only works with
lua5.2 or higher):

  export BINARY=yes

Optional dependency:
* lua-readline
For history completion
