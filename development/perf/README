perf is a userspace interface to the kernel's perf events. Performance
counters are CPU hardware registers that count hardware events
such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches
mispredicted. They form a basis for profiling applications to trace
dynamic control flow and identify hotspots.

Please note that this SBo doesn't have any sources in the DOWNLOAD
setting, as the sources are already part of a full slackware install.

Optional dependencies: audit, numactl, libunwind
