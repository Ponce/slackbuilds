Source Navigator NG is a source code analysis tool. With it, you can edit your
source code, display relationships between classes and functions and members,
and display call trees.

You can navigate your source code and easily get to declarations or
implementations of functions, variables and macros (commonly called "symbols")
which helps you discovering and mapping unknown source code for enhancement or
maintenance tasks.

source navigator NG is free software and released under the GPL v2. It is based
upon the old source navigator and strives to improve usability and performance.
