This is an implementation of the pgsql and pdo_pgsql PHP extensions for HHVM.

Once you've installed hhvm-pgsql, create the following lines in
/etc/hhvm/php.ini (create one if it doesn't exist):
	extension_dir = /usr/lib64/hhvm/extensions
	hhvm.extensions[pgsql] = pgsql.so

Restart the HipHop virtual machine.
