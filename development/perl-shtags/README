shtags.pl is a script to generate tag files for shell and perl scripts.

USAGE: shtags.pl [-kvwVx] [-t <file>] <files>
 -t <file>  Name of tags file to create. (default is 'tags')
 -s <shell> Name of the shell language in the script
 -v         Include variable definitions.
            (variables mentioned at the start of a line)
 -V         Print version information.
 -w         Suppress "duplicate tag" warnings.
 -x         Explicitly create a new tags file. Normally tags are merged.
 <files>    List of files to scan for tags.

This is an update to the one that comes with vim, modified to use
Getopt::Std rather than the older getopts.pl that came with perl4.

Supported script types:

sh     Bourne Shell (including bash, but use -s sh)
perl   Perl (versions 4 and 5)
ksh    Korn Shell
tclsh  The TCL shell
wish   The TK Windowing shell (same as tclsh)

See man (1) shtags for more information.
