Jam - Make(1) Redux

Jam is a program construction tool, like make(1). Jam recursively
builds target files from source files, using dependency information
and updating actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written
in jam's own interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled
into jam and provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a
user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
