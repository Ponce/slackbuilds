# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

jam: Jam (Make Redux)
jam:
jam: Jam is a program construction tool, like make(1). Jam recursively
jam: builds target files from source files, using dependency information
jam: and updating actions expressed in the Jambase file, which is written
jam: in jam's own interpreted language. The default Jambase is compiled
jam: into jam and provides a boilerplate for common use, relying on a
jam: user-provide file "Jamfile" to enumerate actual targets and sources.
