PForth is a  public domain, portable ANS Forth based on a kernel written in
in ANSI 'C'. This makes it easy to port pForth to multiple platforms. So
far, pForth has run on Macs, PCs, SUNs, Amigas, Linux, BeOS, Nokia
Communicator, SGI Indys, 3DO ARM systems, 3DO PowerPC systems, WebTV
systems, Hitachi SH4, OpenTV prototypes, Compaq Ipaq 3970, Sharp LH79520
ARM processor, Ciena Systems networking hardware, and some internal
projects at Lucent. If you build pForth for an embedded system, please let
me know and I will add your machine to the list of machines that pForth
has run on.
