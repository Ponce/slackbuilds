# 20201224 bkw: BUILD=3, fixed, for real this time. I think. BUILD=2
# version worked only if fbc was already installed :(

# 20201211 bkw: modified by SlackBuilds.org, to build FreeBASIC from source
# instead of using prebuilt binary packages. There are various reasons for
# wanting to do this:

# - The prebuilt binaries were built on an OS where the terminfo fuctions
#   from ncurses were split into a separate library (libtinfo). Using
#   the binary package on Slackware 14.2 means creating a libtinfo
#   symlink in /usr/lib64, which can cause problems later (e.g. if
#   something else links with it, no harm done... until you removepkg
#   FreeBASIC). Also, there are reports on the mailing list of fbc
#   being unable to compile FreeBASIC code that uses curses, even with
#   the symlink in place. Building it on our OS prevents this issue.
#   The folks on the mailing list "solved" this problem by reverting to
#   the FreeBASIC version from the 14.0 repo, which is what prompted
#   me to fix this build...

# - In the same vein, the prebuilt binaries have /usr/lib/freebasic hardcoded,
#   so there had to be a symlink to lib64 on Slackware64.

# - General paranoia about trusting prebuilt binaries.

# - If we build it, we get FreeBASIC bindings for various libraries that
#   are installed, e.g. mysql and libart_lgpl.

# - I was hoping that compiling from source would fix a couple other
#   problems. The sdl2-hello example segfaults with both the prebuilt
#   and built-from-source fbc :(
