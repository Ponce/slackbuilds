github-desktop (Desktop client for GitHub)

This is a re-pack of the official DEB package.

Fork of GitHub Desktop to support various Linux distributions.

64-bit only. It will spit an error on a 32-bit system.

The script also supports aarch64 but you must manually wget the file
as the .info cannot support it directly.
