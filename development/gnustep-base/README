GNUstep is a free, object-oriented, cross-platform development environment
that strives for simplicity and elegance.  GNUstep is based on and completely
compatible with the OpenStep specification developed by NeXT (now Apple
Computer Inc.) as well as implementing the extensions added by Apple in the
form of Cocoa.

This package contains GNUstep-base component of the core libraries needed to
write non-graphic tools in Objective-C.  It includes all of the classes
necessary for writing an incredible array of tools, from wrappers for system
tools to tools for communicating with web and other types of servers.
