Shiboken is a fundamental piece on the Qt for Python project that serves two purposes:

- Generator: Extract information from C or C++ headers and generate CPython code that
allow to bring C or C++ projects to Python. This process uses a library called ApiExtractor
which internally uses Clang.

- Module: An utility Python module that exposed new Python types, functions to handle pointers,
among other things, that is written in CPython and can use independently of the generator.
