By using the OsmoSDR block you can take advantage 
of a common software api in your application(s) 
independent of the underlying radio hardware. 

Depending to your hardware you may want to
install some or all of the optional dependencies: 
rtl-sdr, uhd, osmo-sdr, gr-iqbal, hackrf. 
(the last two is recomended).

Optional: MiriSDR, bladeRF, airspy and Dongle Pro+.
