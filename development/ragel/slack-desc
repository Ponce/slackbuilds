# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ragel: ragel (State Machine Compiler)
ragel:
ragel: Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular
ragel: languages. Ragel targets C, C++, Objective-C, D, Java and Ruby.
ragel: Ragel state machines can not only recognize byte sequences as regular
ragel: expression machines do, but can also execute code at arbitrary points
ragel: in the recognition of a regular language. Code embedding is done using
ragel: inline operators that do not disrupt the regular language syntax.
