Glade (GTK+3 User Interface Builder)

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user
interfaces for the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format,
enabling easy integration with external tools.

This version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the original
Glade codebase.

Please note that this version is different than glade3 provided by 
Slackware, which is glade3-3.8.3 for GTK+2; this package is for GTK+3.

pygobject3 is an optional dependency.
