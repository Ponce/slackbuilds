asl (portable macro cross assembler)

ASL is a portable macro cross assembler for a variety of
microprocessors and microcontrollers. Though it is mainly
targeted at embedded processors and single-board computers,
there are also CPU families in the target list that are used
in workstations and PCs. For a full list of targets, see:

Note: The source downloaded is a snapshot. There hasn't been an ASL
release since 1999, although development snapshots are still released
every month or so.

Build options:

UTF8=no - Set this in the environment if you want ASL to use
ISO-8859-1 for its log and error messages. By default, UTF-8 is used.

TESTS=no - Don't run ASL's test suite. This should only be used on
slow systems to save building time.
