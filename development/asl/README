asl (portable macro cross assembler)

ASL is a portable macro cross assembler for a variety of
microprocessors and microcontrollers. Though it is mainly
targeted at embedded processors and single-board computers,
there are also CPU families in the target list that are used
in workstations and PCs. For a full list of targets, see:

Note: The source downloaded is a snapshot. There hasn't been an ASL
release since 1999, although development snapshots are still released
every month or so.

Build options:

UTF8=yes - Set this in the environment if you want ASL to use UTF-8 for
its log and error messages. By default, ISO-8859-1 is used.

TESTS=no - Don't run ASL's test suite. This should only be used on slow
systems to save building time.

DOCTYPES - ASL's documentation can be installed as HTML, PDF,
PostScript, and/or plain text. DOCTYPES is a space-separated
list of formats, which may include any of: html pdf ps txt. The
default is "html". If you plan to print a copy of the docs, you
might want e.g. DOCTYPES="html pdf".  All formats are installed to
/usr/doc/asl-$VERSION/, as usual.
