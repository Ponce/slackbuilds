CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in spirit to JUnit,
CppUnit, and xUnit.  CxxTest is easy to use because it does not require
precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it employs no advanced features of C++
(e.g. RTTI) and it supports a very flexible form of test discovery.

Package ply is an optional runtime dependency: it's needed for the FOG C++
parser.
