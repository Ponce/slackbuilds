OpenJDK 8 is an open source implementation of version 8 of the
Java Development Kit, Standard Edition. It includes tools for developing,
testing, and running programs written in Java.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's that you
have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the PATH, JAVA_HOME
and MANPATH variables (this includes the 'openjdk' dependency package -- you
may wish to remove it after you're done.)

After installing the package you will need to logout/reboot your machine
as it will add new files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

This script may take a couple of hours to complete and will require
about 11 GB of disk space for its temporary directory. It defaults to
"/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./openjdk8.SlackBuild

The 'cacerts' binary is a keystore containing CA certificates which
are used by Java applications. It is taken from the CentOS package
'ca-certificates-2015.2.4-65.0.1.el6_6.noarch.rpm'.

If you get an error like

Internal compiler error: java.lang.NullPointerException at
org.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.ReadManager.run(ReadManager.java:166)

simply run the build again. This happens early so it shouldn't be that of a
problem.  At least 1 out of 5 runs so far have always succeded.
