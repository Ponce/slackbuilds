Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software
application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to make
internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a
graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their
thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way.

The software is free for personal use, with commercial licenses
available for pay
