Chicken is a compiler that translates Scheme source files into C,
which in turn can be fed to a C compiler to generate a standalone 
executable.  An interpreter is also available and can be used as a 
scripting environment or for test programs before compilation. 
Scheme is a member of the Lisp family of languages.
