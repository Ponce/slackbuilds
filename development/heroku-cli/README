The Heroku CLI is used to manage Heroku apps from the command line. 

Overview
This is the next generation Node-based Heroku CLI.
The goals of this project were to make plugins more flexible, 
remove Ruby as a runtime dependency, and make the CLI faster.

It has identical functionality to the old Ruby CLI.
Under the hood, it is a modular CLI made up of node.js plugins.
