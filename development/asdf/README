asdf is a CLI tool that can manage multiple language runtime
versions on a per-project basis. All tool version definitions
are contained within one file (.tool-versions) which you can
check in your project's Git repository to share with your team,
ensuring everyone is using the exact same versions of tools.

It is like gvm, nvm, rbenv & pyenv (and more) all in one!
Simply install your language's plugin!

Before you can use asdf, you'll need to configure your shell.

If you use Bash, add the following to ~/.bash_profile (required):
  export PATH="${ASDF_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.asdf}/shims:$PATH"

If ou use ZSH, add the following to ~/.zshrc (required):
  export PATH="${ASDF_DATA_DIR:-$HOME/.asdf}/shims:$PATH"

Most users DO NOT need to customize the location that asdf writes
plugin, install, and shim data to. However, if $HOME/.asdf isn't
the directory you want asdf writing to, you can change it.

Specify the directory by exporting a variable named ASDF_DATA_DIR
in your shell's RC file:
  export ASDF_DATA_DIR="/your/custom/data/dir"

To setup your language's plugin, follow the getting started guide.
A offline version is available on:
