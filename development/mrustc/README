mrustc - alternative rust compiler

This project is an attempt at creating a simple rust compiler in C++,
with the ultimate goal of being a separate re-implementation.

This slackbuild will build and package mrustc and additionally build
the official rust 1.19.0 with stdlib.

This script may take a while to complete (around one hour on a 10
core machine) and will require about 19GB (!) of disk space for its
temporary directory. It defaults to "/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it
like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./mrustc.SlackBuild
