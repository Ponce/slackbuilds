Net::Write - a portable interface to open and send raw data to network

Net::Write provides a portable interface to open a network interface, and be
able to write raw data directly to the network. It juste provides three
methods when a Net::Write object has been created for an interface: open,
send, close.
It is possible to open a network interface to send frames at layer 2 (you
craft a frame from link layer), or at layer 3 (you craft a frame from network
layer), or at layer 4 (you craft a frame from transport layer).

This package requires perl-Class-Gomor, perl-Net-Pcap and perl-Socket6 from
SlackBuilds.org
