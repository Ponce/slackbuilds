Cython version to support Kivy

Cython is a language that makes writing C extensions for the Python 
language as easy as Python itself. Cython is based on the well-known 
Pyrex, but supports more cutting edge functionality and optimizations.

NOTE: This package conflicts with Slackware's Cython and thus is 
intended to replace it. Both should not be installed at the same time.
