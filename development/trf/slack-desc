# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

trf: trf (transformer extension library for Tcl)
trf:
trf: Trf extends the TCL language at the C-level with so-called
trf: ``transformer'' procedures. With the help of some patches to the core
trf: the package is able to intercept all read/write operations on
trf: designated channels, thus giving it the ability to transform the
trf: buffer contents as desired. This allows things like transparent
trf: encryption, compression, charset recoding, etc.
