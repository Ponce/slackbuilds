Ebe IDE

This is for Assembly and C/C++ as well as Fortran.
It has a "Toy Box" to help anyone with learning a little of
C++ and Fortran and is designed for learning Assembly language.

If launching this through Fluxbox's menu, you may encounter a warning
message concerning gdb when you run a program in the terminal.
You can ignore this message, and it has a gdb console.
