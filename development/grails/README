Grails (Groovy on Rails)
Web framework based on the Groovy

It is intended to be a high-productivity framework by following
the "coding by convention" paradigm, providing a stand-alone
development environment and hiding much of the configuration
detail from the developer.

You need setup GRAILS_HOME environment variable; this SlackBuild
provides one for sh and csh. You can logout and login again or
simply run:

# source /etc/profile.d/grails.sh
