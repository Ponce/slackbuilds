GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, DBX, 
WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, the bash debugger, or the Python 
debugger. Besides "usual" front-end features such as viewing source texts, 
DDD has become famous through its interactive graphical data display, where 
data structures are displayed as graphs.
