IdleX is a collection of over twenty extensions and plugins that provide 
additional functionality to IDLE, a Python IDE provided in the standard 
library. It transforms IDLE into a more useful tool for academic research 
and development as well as exploratory programming.
IdleX runs with Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x.

If you want to build this for use with Python 3.x (needs the
optional dependency python3) pass the script PYTHON3=yes, like:

PYTHON3=yes ./idlex.SlackBuild
