Qt Creator 3 is a Cross-Platform Qt IDE.

The goal of Qt Creator is to provide a cross-platform, complete 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop Qt projects.


NOTES:
1 - This package conflicts with qt-creator (version 2): install 
    only one of the two.

2 - This version of Qt Creator is advised for Qt5.

3 - Before start building/editing your application, you should
    configure the Qt kits (both Qt4 and Qt5).

4 - QmlDesigner will work properly only if you configure the Qt5
    Kit properly (Tools->Options->Build & Run->Kits) and make
    it the Default Kit.

5 - An old IDE configuration in user home directory
    (.config/QtProject*) also can lead to strange behavior.

6 - Examples, Qt5 docs and tutorials are not part of this
    package (except for Qt Creator Docs itself).
    To build Qt5 with documentations and examples do as
    follow:
    EXAMPLES=yes DOCS=yes ./qt5.SlackBuild

    Upgrading from Qt5 5.4.* to Qt5 5.5 can lead to errors
    when building the Qt5 docs. So, remove Qt5 before upgrading.
