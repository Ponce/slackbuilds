Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

This is the Python 3 version of matplotlib and can coexist with
SBo's matplotlib package.

NOTES: 1 - If you want to enable the optional subpackages tests
           and toolkits_tests you need to install Python 3
           versions of nose and mock before matplotlib. THESE
           AREN'T YET AVAILABLE AS SLACKBUILDS!
           To enable the above mentioned subpackages you have to
           set the variables DISABLE_TESTS and DISABLE_TK_TESTS
           respectively to "no".
           toolkits_tests doesn't get installed, if test and/or
           toolkits are disabled. The installation of toolkits is
           done automatically.

        2 - pytz dependency must be compiled with Python 3 support.
