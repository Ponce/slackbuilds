Matplotlib strives to produce publication quality 2D graphics for
interactive graphing, scientific publishing, user interface
development and web application servers targeting multiple user
interfaces and hardcopy output formats.  The 'pylab' mode
of ipython uses matplotlib to emulate matlab graphics.

This is the Python 3 version of matplotlib and can coexist with
SBo's matplotlib package.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES: python3-PyQt5, wxPython4, python3-pytest, ffmpeg,
                       avconv, Inkscape


NOTES: If you want to enable the optional subpackages tests and
       toolkits_tests you need to set the variable ENABLE_TESTS
       to "yes" when executing the SlackBuild and make sure that
       python3-pytest, ffmpeg, avconv and Inkscape are already
       installed. Besides ffmpeg/avconv are also needed if you
       wish better support of animation output formats.

       The pytz dependency must be compiled with Python 3 support.
