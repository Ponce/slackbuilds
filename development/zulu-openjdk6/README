This is a SlackBuild to repackage the Azul's Zulu build of OpenJDK that
is compliant with the Java SE 6 standard.

Before installing this package please consider any other jdk's/jre's
that you have already installed as they may cause conflicts with the
PATH, JAVA_HOME and MANPATH variables.

After installing the package you will need to logout/reboot your machine
as it will add files to the /etc/profile.d folder.

Note: zulu-openjdk6 does not have a browser plugin nor support for Java
      Network Launching Protocol (JNLP).
