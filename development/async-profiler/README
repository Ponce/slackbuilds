Sampling CPU and HEAP profiler for Java featuring AsyncGetCallTrace
+ perf_events

This project is a low overhead sampling profiler for Java that does
not suffer from the Safepoint bias problem. It features
HotSpot-specific API to collect stack traces and to track memory
allocations. The profiler works with OpenJDK and other Java runtimes
based on the HotSpot JVM.

Unlike traditional Java profilers, async-profiler monitors non-Java
threads (e.g., GC and JIT compiler threads) and shows native and
kernel frames in stack traces.
