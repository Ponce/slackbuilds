The J-Link software gives you the USB drivers needed for your system, a number
of utilities as well as a dynamically linkable library used by most of the IDEs
and debuggers using J-Link. Also included are a number of sample setup scripts
for devices needing one as well as documentation.

NOTE:
1. This SlackBuild is not sbopkg compatible because source download requires
   licence acceptance (the link provided in .info points to download site)
   and the source tarball name is different from the resulting package name.
2. This SlackBuild repackages the official J-Link binary package.
3. The official binary package bundles libedit, which is also available from
   slackbuilds.org so I decided to go with the one from slackbuilds.org and
   not with the bundled one. BTW, ldd shows that libedit is not used at all.
4. The original udev rules change the device permissions to 0666.
   This SlackBuild modifies the rules, so that the permissions are 0664 and
   the group is plugdev. Make sure to make yourself a member of this group.
