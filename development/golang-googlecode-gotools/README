golang-googlecode-gotools

Provides a couple of tools for working with the Go programming
language. Like godoc, a code vetting analysis utility and others.

This also provides the import path of code.google.com/p/go.tools for
the Go programming language. These libraries are source only.  To
compile using the libraries, include "/usr/share/gocode" in your GOPATH

This package currently builds a historic version of tools from when they were
removed from the core golang repo.

Users may wish to install updated commands, like:
```
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/godoc
```

or in future golang versions (>= go1.17):
```
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```
