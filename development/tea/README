TEA is the text editor for UNIX-like systems and Windows. With an
ultimate small size, TEA provides you hundreds of functions.

TEA is by default built against qt4.  In building TEA against qt5,
install qt5 (from slackbuilds.org) and run the script with the
following command:

QT5=yes ./tea.SlackBuild
