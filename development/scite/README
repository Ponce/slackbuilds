SciTE is a SCIntilla based Text Editor. Originally built to demonstrate
Scintilla, it has grown to be a generally useful editor with facilities
for building and running programs. It is best used for jobs with simple
configurations.

There are example configuration files provided with the tarball.
If you'd like to use it (at your own risk), 
see the different options at http://www.scintilla.org/SciTEDoc.html, 
rename SciTEUser.properties.new to .SciTEUser.properties,
and place it in your user's homedir.

Please look into /usr/doc/scite-3.54 after installation to find
the example configuration files and additional documentation.
