MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language,
providing an interpreter, compiler, source-code debugger, integrated
Emacs-like editor, and a large runtime library. MIT/GNU Scheme is best
suited to programming large applications with a rapid development cycle.

The following build options are available:

  X11=yes|no          Enable support for x11 (default: yes)
  EDWIN=yes|no        Enable support for the Edwin editor (default: yes)
  IMAIL=yes|no        Enable support for the Imail mail reader (default:
                      no), implies Edwin support
  DOCS=yes|no         Include html and pdf documentation (default: no),
                      requires texlive

where each build option may be passed to the slackbuild. Example of
disabling x11 and enabling documentation support:

  X11=no DOCS=yes sh ./mit-scheme.SlackBuild
