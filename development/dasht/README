dasht is a collection of shell scripts for searching, browsing, and
managing API documentation (in the form of 150+ offline documentation
sets, courtesy of Dash for OS X) all from the comfort of your own
terminal!

The name "dasht" is a portmanteau of Dash and the letter "t", for
terminal.  Etymologically, "dasht" is Persian for plain, as in an flat
expanse of land, which aptly characterizes the terminal environment
where everything is text.

Optional dependencies:
* w3m to display dasht(1) search results
* socat for dasht-server(1) search engine
