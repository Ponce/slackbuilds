The srcML format is a XML representation for source code, where
the markup tags identify elements of the abstract syntax for
the language. The srcml program is a command line application
for the conversion of source code to srcML, an interface for the
exploration, analysis, and manipulation of source code in this form,
and the conversion of srcML back to source code. The current parsing
technologies support C/C++, C#, and Java.

srcML requires some statically compiled Boost libraries which are
not available in Slackware's default installation. Thus, the required
libraries are compiled temporarily according to srcML's documentation
but will not be installed into your system. Also, srcML's Python
binding will not be installed.

To build this its dependency antlr2 must be built against jdk (or
openjdk).
