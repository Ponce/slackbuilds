The srcML format is a XML representation for source code, where the markup
tags identify elements of the abstract syntax for the language. The srcml
program is a command line application for the conversion of source code to
srcML, an interface for the exploration, analysis, and manipulation of source
code in this form, and the conversion of srcML back to source code. The
current parsing technologies support C/C++, C#, and Java.

srcML requires some statically compiled Boost libraries which are not
available in Slackware's default installation. Thus, the required libraries
are compiled temporarily according to srcML's documentation but will not be
installed into your system. Also, srcML's Python binding will not be
installed.
