# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

srcML: srcML (document-oriented XML representation of source code)
srcML:
srcML: The srcML format is a XML representation for source code, where the
srcML: markup tags identify elements of the abstract syntax for the language.
srcML: The srcml program is a command line application for the conversion
srcML: of source code to srcML, an interface for the exploration, analysis,
srcML: and manipulation of source code in this form, and the conversion of
srcML: srcML back to source code. The current parsing technologies support
srcML: C/C++, C#, and Java.
