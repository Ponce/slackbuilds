universal-ctags has the objective of continuing the development from
what existed in the Sourceforge area. Github exuberant-ctags
repository was started by Reza Jelveh and was later moved to the
universal-ctags organization.

The goal of the project is preparing and maintaining common/unified working
space where people interested in making ctags better can work
together.

Note that the resulting package will overwrite Exuberant Ctags included in
Slackware's vim package:
/usr/bin/ctags
/usr/man/man1/ctags.1.gz
In case you remove this package, you'll need to reinstall vim.
