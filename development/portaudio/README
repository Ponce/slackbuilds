PortAudio provides a very simple API for recording and/or playing
sound using a simple callback function or a blocking read/write
interface. Example programs are included that play sine waves,
process audio input (guitar fuzz), record and playback audio, list
available audio devices, etc.

Optional dependencies: jack-audio-connection-kit
