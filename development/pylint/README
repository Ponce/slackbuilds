Pylint is a python tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding
standard.  Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all
tests you can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. But
Pylint offers some more features, like checking line-code's length,
checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding
standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented, and
much more (see the complete check list).

The big advantage with Pylint is that it is highly configurable,
customizable, and you can easily write a small plugin to add a personal
feature.
