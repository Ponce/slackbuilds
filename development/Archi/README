Archi (Archimate Modelling)

The Open Source modelling toolkit for creating ArchiMate models and
sketches.
Used by Enterprise Architects everywhere.

The Archi® modelling toolkit is targeted toward all levels of
Enterprise Architects and Modellers. It provides a low cost to entry
solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate
modelling language, or who are looking for an open source,
cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or
institution and wish to engage with the language within a TOGAF® or
other Enterprise Architecture framework.

Note:
There may be a few user interface problems in Archi under Wayland.
If this is the case, you could try running Archi in Linux with
X Windows (X11 or X Org).

You MUST remove any previous installation of Archi to avoid
error because of old plugin dependencies in the previous installation.
