# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

vispatch: vispatch (VIS Patching for Quake BSPs)
vispatch:      
vispatch: VisPatch is a tool for patching quake maps for transparent water in
vispatch: glquake. Original quake didn't have their maps water-vised, so 
vispatch: people did that by themselves and prepared patch data files. This
vispatch: tool is used for preparing and applying those patch files.
