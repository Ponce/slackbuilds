VisPatch is a tool for patching quake maps for transparent water in glquake. Original quake didn't have
their maps water-vis'ed, so people did that by themselves and prepared patch data files. This tool is
used for preparing and applying those patch files.

At the time this tool was written, re-vis'ing maps took a lot of time, but applying a vispatch took
less than minutes, so this was a necessity. Even today, if people don't want going into a 'complex'
job of vising, this tool comes as a great convenience because there are a lot of vispatch data files
around.

This is a revised version of Andy Bay's 1.2a source code for unix (linux, freebsd, ...), as well as
windows. It fixes a number of compilation issues, crashes and some other bugs, and resolves endianness
issues. The source code is licensed under GPLv2, and is maintained here with portability in mind.
