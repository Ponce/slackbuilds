The EAGLE Layout Editor is an easy to use, yet powerful tool for designing
printed circuit boards (PCBs).  The name EAGLE is an acronym, which stands
for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor.  The program consists
of three main modules (Layout Editor, Schematic Editor, and Autorouter)
which are embedded in a single user interface.

If EAGLE prompts for a license key the first time it is
run, point it toward the freeware license file located at
/opt/eagle-VERSION/bin/freeware.key, or purchase a license to unlock
advanced features.

After the key is accepted, you may wish to change the permission of
/opt/eagle-VERSION/bin/eagle.key so that it is no longer world-writable.

  # chmod 0644 /opt/eagle-<version>/bin/eagle.key

This script installs the English documentation. With version 5.10.0
German and (some) Chinese documentation is included as well. To select
them, run this script as:

  # DOC_LANG=<xx> ./eagle.SlackBuild

where <xx> = "de" for German, "zh" for Chinese, or "all".
