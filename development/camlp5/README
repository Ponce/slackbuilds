Camlp5 is the successor to camlp4 (included in the ocaml SlackBuild)
and offers pretty-printing and preprocessing for the ocaml language.

The source can be compiled in two "modes": transitional or strict.
This slackbuild compiles it in the default "transitional" mode, to
maintain compatibility with camlp4.

This requires ocaml.
