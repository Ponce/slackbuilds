# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

scons: cross-platform substitute for the classic Make utility with
scons: integrated functionality similar to autoconf/automake and
scons: compiler caches such as ccache.  In short, SCons is an easier,
scons: more reliable and faster way to build software.
