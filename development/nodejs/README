Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

WARNING: nodejs will conflict with node.

Either install the node package, or nodejs (recommended) from SBo, but not both. Both packages include npm.

nodejs is based off of iojs, you should test your project with nodejs before switching from the node package. Due to significant breaking changes, you may need to update your project to be compatible.
