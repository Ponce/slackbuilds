Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it 
lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest 
ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

WARNING: nodejs will conflict with node.

Either install the node package, or nodejs from SBo, but not both. Both packages 
include npm.
