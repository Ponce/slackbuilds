MySQL Workbench is a cross-platform, visual database design
tool developed by MySQL.  It is the highly anticipated successor
application of the DBDesigner4 project.  MySQL Workbench is available
as a native GUI tool on Windows, Linux, and OS X in different
editions.

MySQL Workbench provides DBAs and developers an integrated tools
environment for:
* Database Design & Modeling
* SQL Development (replacing MySQL Query Browser)
* Database Administration (replacing MySQL Administrator)

You need to allow MySQL to accept incoming connections from outside:
For Slackware 15.0, this option is in /etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld.
Remove or comment this line:  SKIP="--skip-networking"  and then do:
/etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld restart

NOTE: For current, this option is moved to /etc/default/mariadb
Remove --skip-networking from MARIADB_OPTIONS line

Note: MySQL Workbench will be built against Python 2.7 even when
Python 3.x is installed on your system

NOTE: You may need to run mysql_upgrade if mysql-workbench could not
fetch your metadata. You may need to add this into /etc/ld.so.conf:
/usr/lib{64}/mysql-workbench

NOTE: This script requires a lot of RAM in order to build. If you have
small amount of memory, please consider adding zram.
