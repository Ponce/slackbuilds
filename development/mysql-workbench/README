MySQL Workbench is a cross-platform, visual database design
tool developed by MySQL.  It is the highly anticipated successor
application of the DBDesigner4 project.  MySQL Workbench is available
as a native GUI tool on Windows, Linux, and OS X in different
editions.

MySQL Workbench provides DBAs and developers an integrated tools
environment for:
* Database Design & Modeling
* SQL Development (replacing MySQL Query Browser)
* Database Administration (replacing MySQL Administrator)

You need to allow MySQL to accept incoming connections from outside:
Remove or comment this line:  SKIP="--skip-networking"  and then do:
/etc/rc.d/rc.mysqld restart

Note: MySQL Workbench will be built against Python 2.7 even when
Python 3.x is installed on your system
