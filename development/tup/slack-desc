# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tup: tup (A file-based build system)
tup:
tup: Tup is a file-based build system for Linux, OSX, and Windows. It
tup: takes as input a list of file changes and a directed acyclic graph
tup: (DAG). It then processes the DAG to execute the appropriate commands
tup: required to update dependent files. Updates are performed with very
tup: little overhead since tup implements powerful build algorithms to
tup: avoid doing unnecessary work. This means you can stay focused on
tup: your project rather than on your build system.
