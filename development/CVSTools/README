The CVSTools provide a simple project versioning system built upon
CVS which is used by all PADL software.  These tools are also required
to build NetInfo for Linux and our commerial software.  The following
scripts are included in CVSTools:

checkpoint:
Based on Apple's checkpoint program, this creates Perl program the
CVSVersionInfo.txt file for a work area (when invoked with -create).
To checkpoint (i.e. increment the version number and create a CVS tag)
type checkpoint with no arguments, or with the new version number as
an argument.

cvslib.pl:
Common library functions used by some of these scripts for getting
the repository and project names.  One can override CVSVersionInfo.txt
location with the CVSVERSIONDIR environment variable, which is useful
for nested source trees where one wishes to pull in the top level
version info for the project name, and the current directory name for
the program.

tarup:
Executes cvs export and then creates a tarball in
~/dist/project-version.tar.gz.

vers_string
Equivalent of OS X's /usr/bin/vers_string, instead using
CVSVersionInfo.txt the repository and project names.
