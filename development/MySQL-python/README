MySQL-python (Python interface to MySQL)

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for
Python.  The design goals are:

    * Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]
    * Thread-safety
    * Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-3.23 through 5.5 and Python-2.4 through 2.7 are currently
supported.
