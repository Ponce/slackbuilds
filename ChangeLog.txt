Okay, here's a big batch of updates and additions resulting from several hours
  of work over the holidays  :-)  Several of you (submitters) requested some
  feedback in your submission notes, and while we were able to reply to a few
  of the mails, many of them did not get a reply due to time constraints.
  Have a look at the approved scripts, note the differences, and if any of the
  reasons for those differences aren't clear, let us know on the -users list
  and we'll try to clarify.  As always, be sure to sync your local copies of
  the scripts and support files with the ones in our repository before you
  submit any updates and such.  Enjoy!  -RW

Wed Aug 26 10:00:38 CDT 2009
Well, it's that time again - the newest release of Slackware (13.0) is now
  on the mirrors, and since we know everyone is itching for SlackBuilds.org
  goodness, we (hopefully) won't disappoint you.  As usual, the ChangeLog is
  quite long, and perhaps even longer than usual this time around.  There are
  quite a few new additions to the tree, many old and unmaintained removals,
  and many updates.  It's entirely possible (likely even) that we neglected
  to fix all of the README files, so if you find any mentions of stuff that
  that's now part of Slackware (and thus doesn't need to be noted as a dep),
  let us know.  Of course, other bug reports are also encouraged, but maybe
  there won't be many of those :-)
  Congratulations to Pat and the Slackware team for another fine release, and
  we hope you all enjoy Slackware 13.0 and the updated SlackBuilds.org stuff.
  As always, thanks for your support and encouragement of both the Slackware
  team and us; happy Slacking!  -- the SlackBuilds.org Admin Team

  office/basket: Removed; this requires kde3. --michiel
  office/gnumeric: Removed; the 1.8.x "stable" branch requires quite a few
    gnome libs, and since we had 1.9.1 already for 12.2, I'd rather not roll
    back to 1.8.x.  However, every new release of 1.9.x bumps the libgsf
    requirement to whatever is the latest at that particular time, so no
    matter what we here, it's highly likely that it will be wrong in the
    near future.  Therefore, we'll wait for 13.0 to release and let the
    gnumeric maintainer find a release of it that matches the libgsf that's
    in 13.0.  Sorry for the book.  --rworkman
  office/kmobiletools: kde4 port seems unstable and unmaintained.  --pprkut
  office/kdissert: Removed; This is no longer maintained upstream and
    QT3 only.

    in development, so the maintainer is free to submit an update.  --rworkman
  system/lapsus: no kde4 port available yet.
  system/mrxvt: Removed; the license for this script is GPL, which requires
    it to include a copy of the GPL, which is braindead for a script that's
    *many* times smaller than the GPL itself, so mrxvt is removed until or
    unless the build script is relicensed.  --rworkman

The following entries were not checked at all for 13.0, as we simply ran
  out of time to do them.  We know that some of these were likely mentioned
  on the mailing list, but we were too busy trying to get everything ready
  for the release of 13.0.  Sorry for the inconvenience, but maybe we'll
  be ready for new submissions pretty soon...
