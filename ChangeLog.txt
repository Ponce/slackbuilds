Okay, guys, this is (hopefully) the last of the additions to our 11.0
  repository.  There are two more still in the pending queue, but
  there's a good chance that they won't make the cut this time.
  As we mentioned on the mailing list last week, we are putting the 
  vast majority of our time and effort into getting everything ready 
  for Slackware 12.0's release.  That being the case, if you have
  submitted something that did not get included and you haven't heard 
  from us about it, please resubmit it after we are back to normal 
  (whatever that is) around here after 12.0 releases.
  Thanks to *everyone* for your submissions, public relations help,
  and anything else you did to support the project this past year.
  On a personal note, I (rworkman) would like to extend a big thanks
  to all of the other SlackBuilds.org team members - I greatly 
  appreciate everything you guys have done to help make this project
  a success!   Anyway, enough chatter - on to the good stuff:

First of all, it's probably a good idea to clarify a couple of things from the 
  batch of updates on 20070508.  We credited Volkerding in the gnutls, poppler,
  and poppler-data scripts; in case it's not obvious, he didn't submit them to
  us - we simply pulled them from the Slackware -current sources and modified 
  them as needed to build on 11.0.  In other words, if you experience a problem
  with one of those scripts, don't bother Pat - they're ours.  Now, with all of
  that said, let's get on to the good stuff...   --rworkman

  people still need it.  --robw810

development/mono: Added - Mono is a open-source implementation of the 
  .NET Framework.  Thanks to dadexter.
games/scummvm: Added - ScummVM is a collection of interpreters capable of

libraries/SDL_image: Removed.
libraries/SDL_mixer: Removed.
libraries/SDL_net: Removed.
  These are bundled with the Slackware SDL package.  If you built and
  installed these from SBo and wish to remove them, you will need to
  re-install the official SDL package to get these libraries back.
  This was my fault for not checking closely enough, sorry. --elohim
+--------------------------+
Mon Oct 30 04:20:23 UTC 2006
system/gkrellm-volume: Added - a sound mixer plugin for gkrellm.  Thanks to
  Paul Wisehart.  I made a relatively heavy patch to the Makefiles included
  with this plugin to support installing with DESTDIR, and my changes seem
  fine as far as I can tell here, but let me know if there's anything I 
  missed - we can always manually copy the needed files to their locations.
system/cdrkit: Fixed an overlooked -mcpu flag. 
system/yakuake: Fixed an overlooked -mcpu flag.  Thanks to dadexter for both
  of these - it's nice to have someone with too much time on their hands.  :-)

+--------------------------+

network/opera: Added - opera is a closed-source, but feature-rich and 
  standards-compliant web browser.  This script simply repackages the one
  distributed by opera to make it adhere more closely to Slackware's packaging
  standards.   Thanks to dadexter.       --robw810/elohim
+--------------------------+
Sat Oct 21 02:16:33 UTC 2006
system/apcupsd: Added the --enable-powerflute flag to configure.  Thanks to
  elohim for pointing this out; I've gone all this time without noticing it.
  While I was editing it already, I took the liberty of doing a few other
  miscellaneous script cleanups.  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Thu Oct 19 21:02:41 UTC 2006

Sat Oct 14 16:40:12 UTC 2006
office/openoffice.org: Added a patch to fix the Exec paths given in the
  .desktop files to work around the Xfce bug mentioned below.  This should
  not change anything with respect to other window managers.   --robw810
+--------------------------+
Sat Oct 14 01:20:20 UTC 2006
This is an 'information-only' update related to OpenOffice.org.  After 
  further investigation, it seems as if the problem mentioned below is 
  only present in Xfce 4.4 development versions - it works fine in kde
  and gnome, as well as xfce 4.2.x.  Of course, it could turn out to be 
  completely unrelated, but for now, see this for more information:
  http://bugzilla.xfce.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2430    --robw810
+--------------------------+
Fri Oct 13 05:39:06 UTC 2006
office/openoffice.org: Updated to version 2.0.4.  There is one bug in
  the resulting package - the menu entries created do not start the
  individual office component that they're supposed to call; instead,
  they start the plain office 'shell' - manually running the Exec lines
  in the .desktop files from an xterm results in correct behavior, so
  I'm uncertain as to what the problem may be.  Under normal conditions,
  this wouldn't have been upgraded due to the bug, but it's just now come
  to my attention (thanks to MagicMan), and it was present in the builds
  from the older script as well, so we may as well get this out there so
  that more eyes can have a look at it.  If you happen to find a solution
  before we do, please post a message to slackbuilds-users[at]slackbuilds.org.

  looking at some better code to handle this, but it's not ready yet.

  the script a bit.

  the build process in an operating system and compiler independent
  manner.  Thanks to Motoko-chan.

  libcap, cmake, and zisofs-tools.  Thanks to Motoko-chan.

  monitoring cpu usage, battery level, AC state, and cpu frequency.
  This requires the cpufrequtils package.

  for userspace tools and programs to the cpufreq core and drivers in the 
  Linux kernel.
multimedia/mplayer-codecs-all: Updated to version 20060611.
multimedia/MPlayer: changed the default path of the codecs back to 
  /usr/lib/codecs - this is configurable in the script, and we're going
  to assume that anyone building MPlayer from here has also built the
  codecs from here.  On that note, the README was also edited to reflect
  that the codecs don't actually have to be installed - so long as the
  directory is specified in the configure, support for them will be built.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Sun Oct  1 23:42:25 UTC 2006
multimedia/MPlayer: fixed bad path in doinst.sh script; thanks to Dasajev.
  Changed the default codecs path to /usr/local/lib/codecs, which is what 
  it would be if the user follows the instructions at MPlayer's site - this
  is still configurable in the script in case the user has installed them
  with our SlackBuild script.  Changed the method for gzipping manpages
  (added detection of symlinks); thanks to Eric Hameleers.
misc/wine: Changed manpage detection/gzipping; added mandir=/usr/man to 
  the configure command.  Added better permissions checking in the extracted
  source.  Added support for OpenGL acceleration.  Thanks to Eric Hameleers.
graphics/gqview: Better permissions checking; better manpage compression.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Mon Sep 25 14:21:00 UTC 2006
This one hasn't been explained yet, but we somehow lost three of our scripts
  in the recent work on the site, and we just caught the mistake today.  
  Luckily, elohim had backups... :)   --robw810
development/nano: Added.
multimedia/MPlayer: Added.
network/msmtp: Added.
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 22 21:20:45 UTC 2006
We're mostly finished with the cosmetic changes mentioned below, and some
  of them required some changes to the README requirements.  All things
  considered, this should make things easier on submitters, as the app's
  home page, download location, and md5sum only have to be put into one
  file now, and the README is just for, well, READING purposes.  Anyway,
  make sure you have a look at http://slackbuilds.org/guidelines/ before
  entering any new submissions.
Maybe we can get back to the fun stuff now (like adding new stuff to the 
  repository).  :)    --robw810
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep 21 05:21:52 UTC 2006
Okay, I think we've got everything back to normal (whatever that means) :)
  There are some more cosmetic changes coming to the public portion of the
  site, and some of them should also improve the usability side of things 
  too.  One major change that's been requested is the ability to download
  a tarball of an application's entire directory, and that's now available.
  We're still working on quite a few things in the site backend, but most
  of that will be transparent to the public (or at least that's what we
  hope to be the case).  Anyway, thanks for your patience with us, and
  happy Slackin'  :-)
misc/wine: Updated to wine-0.9.21.  Added semi-official patches for both
  nvidia cards and ati cards that still need one; please read the comments
  in the SlackBuild script.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Fri Sep 15 05:34:15 UTC 2006
We're doing some 'behind the scenes' work on the site backend, so the

desktop/slim: Fixed - config files are no longer clobbered on upgrade.
  --robw810

network/openntpd: Removed.  There are a few issues with this I need to
  work out, so it will be back sooner or later.
office/openoffice.org: Fixed a few issues.  This no longer includes any
  custom *.desktop files; instead, we use the ones included in the original
  binaries.  Also, we no longer add/replace/modify /etc/mailcap or 
  /etc/mime.types on the system - this was badly broken behavior that should
  not have slipped by earlier.
development/cpan2tgz: Added.  cpan2tgz is an app to make Slackware packages
  from perl modules.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Thu Sep  7 12:27:43 EDT 2006
network/rdesktop: Fixed problem in the SlackBuild. I have no idea how this
  slipped through the cracks. An if-else statement wasn't closed, causing
  bash to fail to execute pretty much anything in this script.

Sun Sep  3 03:40:37 UTC 2006
network/snownews: Added. Snownews is a text mode RSS/RDF newsreader.

  Player for KDE.
network/arptables:  Added arptables, an administration tool for arp

system/ulogd: added ulogd man page and logrotate script to the 
  package.  The logrotate script will install as a .new script
  into /etc/logrotate.d/, as many people will need to edit it
  for custom logfile names, and we don't want to clobber the
  custom version on upgrade.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug 23 06:09:15 UTC 2006
multimedia/mpd: Added.  Music Player Daemon allows remote access for

multimedia/MPlayer: added a doinst.sh file to the package to prevent
  clobbering of the existing /etc/mplayer.conf file on upgrade.
Also, I'm in the process of modifying all of the current repository
  to separate the BUILD and TAG variables (BUILD=1 TAG=_SBo), as well
  as a few other minor issues not worth mentioning here (yes, I'm 
  being pedantic)  :)
  --robw810

system/ulogd: Fixed two major problems in the script -
  /usr/local/lib is no longer used (no, I don't know how I missed
  that), and existing config files are no longer clobbered.

+--------------------------+
Mon Aug 14 04:53:05 UTC 2006
system/apcupsd: Fixed the script to prevent overwriting of files
  in /etc/apcupsd/ during an upgrade; doinst.sh now checks for 
  for differences and installs them as *.new if they're not identical.
  The same applies for /etc/rc.d/rc.apcupsd.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Mon Aug 14 03:31:00 UTC 2006

+--------------------------+
Thu Aug 10 23:50:06 UTC 2006
system/hplip: Removed.  This is a temporary removal until I can work 
  out a better way to do a few things - I'm not at all happy with
  any package creating *.new files that are normally considered part
  of other packages, *especially* not sysvinit. 
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Wed Aug  9 18:02:52 UTC 2006
system/apcupsd: Modified to use --sbindir=/sbin instead of /usr/sbin,
  as some systems with /usr on a separate partition might not poweroff
  completely after halt if /usr is unmounted first.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug  8 20:40:32 UTC 2006
network/heimdal: Added - a free Kerberos implementation,
 mostly compatible to MIT Kerberos.
 --alien
+--------------------------+
Mon Aug  7 23:12:46 UTC 2006
Anonymous FTP access to the repository is now available via
  ftp://ftp.slackbuilds.org - this is a feature that got several

  recursive feature :)

  (formerly POSIX 6) draft 15 capabilities

  necessary for some ATI cards.

  OpenAL's ALUT standard; it requires OpenAL (obviously), which
  is also available here.

system/apcupsd: Added - apcupsd is a daemon for controlling APC UPS
  units.  I've implemented some better fixes for apcupsd's broken
  behavior of writing outside DESTDIR during the build process.
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Tue Aug  1 03:29:56 UTC 2006
network/msmtp: Added msmtp, a simple smtp client
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Mon Jul 31 20:19:11 UTC 2006
system/aterm: Added aterm, a terminal emulator
system/apcupsd: Removed.  This is temporary until I fix a few things to
  better work around the broken slackware-specific installation by
  apcupsd's source.  I've got some patches that I've submitted to the
  apcupsd developers, but I want to ensure that they work properly before
  committing them here.
  --robw810

  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Tue Jul 18 23:33:18 UTC 2006
office/acroread: fixed a problem where the symlink for AdobeReader.png
  in /usr/share/pixmaps was incorrect.  The reason for the frequent 
  problems with symlinks is due to the fact that Adobe Reader expects
  to be installed in /opt/Adobe/Acrobat$VERSION/, and the default links
  are created with that assumption.  Anyway, maybe I've got all of the
  bugs stomped by now... :)
  --robw810
+--------------------------+
Tue Jul 18 15:33:10 UTC 2006

  --robw810
+--------------------------+
