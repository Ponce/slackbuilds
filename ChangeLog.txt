libraries/GConf: Fixed a bug in the build script which would cause
  /etc/gconf/2/path to be overwritten on upgrade.  I hadn't planned
  on doing any more updates to the 12.0 tree, but this was uncovered
  in testing for 12.1, and since I had to update the md5sum anyway,
  why not?  :)  --rworkman

Unless something else critical jumps out before 12.1 releases, this will
  probably be the final update to the 12.0/ repository.  Adobe says that
  these new flash player builds fix some security issues, so we decided
  to go ahead and get these out.

Fri Mar 28 15:34:04 UTC 2008
First of all, you might notice a change in your browser's address bar
  when search results are displayed - there's more information there than
  just the generic "http://slackbuilds.org/result/" now.  This should be
  handy for quite a few things, not the least of which is giving links to
  search results.  We'd like to pass on a BIG thanks to "duryodhan" for
  clueing us in on this simple change to our site's code.
  Here's another batch of updates to the 12.0 tree, and there's still at
  at least one more to come.  Hopefully this gives you some idea as to 
  why there's often a significant delay before a submission shows up in 
  the repository -- this number of pending submissions in normal.

  decided to close their branch in the town where it was hosted (and forgot
  to let the owners know).  If DNS changes have propagated out to everyone

Slackware 12.0 is (almost) released!  Early congratulations to Pat and 
  the team for turning out yet another great release. 
We've been working for the last month or so (mostly) behind the scenes
  on getting everything ready for use on Slackware 12.0 - including 
  the actual website itself.  You'll notice a few minor changes to the
  site, but from a usability standpoint, it should be the same or better.
  Among other changes, you'll notice that the search box now has a way to 
  flag the Slackware version to fine-tune your results (for those of you 
  still using 11.0).  Thanks to Eric Hameleers for the website work!
On the subject of Slackware 11.0, those scripts will remain on the site,
  but we will not be accepting any new submissions for 11.0, nor will any
  of them be updated except for a few cases:
  1. Bugs in the scripts themselves will be fixed if any are found.
  2. Version updates will be considered if the new version is a security
     update *and* it will not build properly with a simple $VERSION change
     to the script.
  3. There is no promise of *any* support for the 11.0 scripts.  We will
     do the best we can, but our priority will be on 12.0 scripts.
With all that said, let's get to the good stuff...  The following scripts
  have been tested and found to build properly on Slackware 12.0 - thanks
  to all of the submitters who responded to our request for testing on the
  mailing list.  If you find any problems with them (especially if the 
  website information is out of sync with what's in the .info file), please 
  let us know on the users mailing list: slackbuilds-users AT slackbuilds.org
  Enjoy!  -- the SlackBuilds.org Team
