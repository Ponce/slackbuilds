POV-Ray: The Persistence of Vision Raytracer is a high-quality,
totally free tool for creating stunning three-dimensional graphics.

The author of POV-Ray asks users who build their own binaries to
include their name and e-mail in the final result.

The included SlackBuild offers this possibility by entering the
information on the command line like this:

  # POVRAY_BUILDER="your name <email@address>" ./povray.SlackBuild

If you leave this variable empty, it will be supplied by the
SlackBuild script as "`whoami` on `hostname`"
