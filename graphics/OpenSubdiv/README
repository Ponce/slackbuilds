OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high performance 
subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively parallel CPU and 
GPU architectures. This code path is optimized for drawing deforming surfaces 
with static topology at interactive framerates.

Additional utility is available in OpenSubdiv when the following SBo packages
are installed and detected at build time:
    tbb cudatoolkit opencl-headers glfw docutils
