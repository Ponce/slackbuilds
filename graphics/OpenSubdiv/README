OpenSubdiv is a set of open source libraries that implement high
performance subdivision surface (subdiv) evaluation on massively
parallel CPU and GPU architectures. This code path is optimized
for drawing deforming surfaces with static topology at interactive
framerates.

Some graphics cards are not supported with the existing version of
the cudatoolkit at SBo. Therefore CUDA backend support is not enabled
by default in this SlackBuild. It must be explicitly enabled (as well
as cudatoolkit being installed) to use it in the build e.g.
    ENABLE_CUDA=yes bash OpenSubdiv.SlackBuild
N.B. Building with CUDA is currently unsupported (broken) - don't use!
