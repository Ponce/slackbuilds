This package lets you export your scene from within Blender to Yafaray. 

This script builds the Blender plugin, which is automatically installed 
in /usr/share/yafaray/blender.
A link to the main plugin file is put in /opt/blender/script, but you can
change this editing the BLENDER_PLUGIN_DIR variable inside the script.
