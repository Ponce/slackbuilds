DCRaw is software for processing RAW image files generated by a host of
digital cameras.  DCRaw by itself only provides a command line interface
for image processing.  DCRaw can also build with a gimp plugin so images
can be edited/exported with gimp.

Run the slackbuild with RAWPHOTO=yes to build the gimp rawphoto plugin

Run the slackbuild with JASPER=yes to build dcraw with jasper support.
Jasper support is disabled by default, so it is an optional dependency.
