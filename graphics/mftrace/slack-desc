# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mftrace: MetaFont tracer (Generate scalable fonts for TeX)
mftrace:
mftrace: Mftrace is a small Python program that lets you trace a TeX bitmap
mftrace: font into a PFA or PFB font (A PostScript Type1 Scalable Font).
mftrace: Type1 fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow
mftrace: PostScript files to render correctly on printers with many
mftrace: resolutions.  Moreover, Ghostscript can generate much better PDF,
mftrace: if given scalable fonts.
