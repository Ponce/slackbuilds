Dia is an application for creating technical diagrams. Its interface and
features are loosely patterned after the Windows program Visio. Its features
include multiple-page printing, export to many formats (EPS, SVG, CGM and
PNG) and the ability to use custom shapes created by the user as simple XML
descriptions. Dia is useful for drawing UML diagrams, network maps and
flowcharts.
