Whyteboard is a painting whiteboard application that runs on Linux and
Windows, that allows the annotation of PDF, PostScript documents and
various image formats with common drawing tools (pen, rectangles, ellipses,
text). A history of your drawing is stored, facilitating the replaying of
your drawing.

Whyteboard enables tabbed painting, with multiple sheets that can be drawn
upon, with each sheet having its own live-updating thumbnail. This allows
the editing of multiple documents or images inside a single instance of
Whyteboard. Each sheet has its own undo and redo operations as well as
its own history replay list.

This requires wxPython.
