gource (software VCS visualization tool)

Software projects are displayed by Gource as an animated tree with
the root directory of the project at its centre: directories appear as
branches with files as leaves; developers can be seen working on the
tree at the times they contributed to the project.  Currently there
is first party support for Git, Mercurial and Bazaar, and third party
(using additional steps) for CVS and SVN.
