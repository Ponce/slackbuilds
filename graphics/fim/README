FIM (Fbi IMproved) is a highly customizable and scriptable image viewer
targeted at the users who are comfortable with software like the Vim
text editor or the Mutt mail user agent. FIM it aims to be a swiss army
knife for viewing images.
 
It is based on the Fbi image viewer (by Gerd Hoffmann), and works
primarily in the Linux frame buffer console.
