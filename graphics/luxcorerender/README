LuxCoreRender 3D rendering engine

LuxRender is a physically based and unbiased rendering engine.
LuxRender simulates the flow of light according to physical equations,
producing realistic images of photographic quality.

It is fully-featured, with a command-line application (`pyluxcoretools`)
as well as a GUI (`luxrenderui`), widespread render farm support,
instancing, volumetrics, motion blur, and more.

This package supports 64-bit systems only, because it installs the
pre-compiled LuxRender package. It is possible to install LuxRender on
32-bit systems, but it requires building from source.

Optional Depencencies:
------------

* cudatoolkit
* nvidia-driver

Install Options:
----------------

You must rename `/etc/OpenCL/vendors/mesa.icd` so LuxCore can locate
a usable OpenCL device.

Use the OPENCL variable when running this script if you want that
done for you (but if you uninstall this package, you must remember
to change it back yourself).

```
$ OPENCL=yes ./luxcorerender.SlackBuild
```

Blender Plugin
--------------

This package is for the stand-alone LuxCoreRender engine.

A Blender plugin is available from luxcorerender.org
