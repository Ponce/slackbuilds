vuescan - Ed Hamrick's scanner software

vuescan is an application for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux that is
compatible with over 2100 scanners from 35 scanner manufacturers.

vuescan is commercial software but free to try indefinitly.
(watermarking the saved images)

vuescan supports many special scanners such as film scanners.

The creators update vuescan about every two weeks - without changing
the download file name. This will lead to md5sum failures. Drop me
a note at heiko<dot>rosemann<at>web<dot>de and I will try to update
the SlackBuild as quickly as possible.
