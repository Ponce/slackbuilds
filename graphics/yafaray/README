YafaRay is a free open-source raytracing engine. Raytracing  is a rendering
technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of light 
through a 3D scene.

This package is built by default with QT4 support (needed if you intend to use
the blender plugin too). If you don't want it, launch the script as follows:
# USEQT=no ./yafaray.SlackBuild (assuming you're root)

You can also build Python bindings, provided you have swig and Python
installed. Simply run
# BUILDPYTHON=yes ./yafaray.SlackBuild (always assuming you're root)
