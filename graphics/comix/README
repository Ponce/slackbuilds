Comix - GTK Comic Book Viewer

Comix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is
specifically designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a
generic viewer. It reads images in ZIP, RAR or tar archives (also
gzip or bzip2 compressed) as well as plain image files. It is written
in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings. 

Dependencies: pil, pygtk, pycairo, pygobject, and unrar (optional)
