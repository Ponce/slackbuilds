comix (Viewer for archived images)

Cartoons are, most of the time, archived.  comix opens an archive file
and displays images in it, removing the need to decompress comicbook
files.  It reads images in zip, rar, or tar(gzip or bzip2) archives.
It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings.

unrar is an optional dependency.
