ExactImage is an image processing library which reimplements ImageMagick 
functions with a significant speed improvement.  The library also provides 
several new algorithms: lossless JPEG transforms and creation of searchable 
PDFs from hOCR annotated HTML created with an OCR program such as Tesseract or 
Cuneiform (available at Slackbuilds.org). There are bindings for PHP, Lua, Perl, 
and Python.  See /usr/doc/exact-image-*/examples/ for information on using 
exactimage with Perl, Python, PHP and Lua.

ExactImage requires agg. Lua and evas are optional dependencies available at 
Slackbuilds.org, while bardecode is optional but not available.
