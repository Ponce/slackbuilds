gdk-pixbuf-psd (gdk-pixbuf2 loader for Photoshop PSD files)

This project aims to provide a GdkPixbuf loader for the PSD file
format.

GdkPixbuf is part of GTK and applications like Eye of GNOME and gThumb
use it to handle image loading. The loader provided by this project
will let those applications open PSD images and enable thumbnails in
nautilus, too.

The loader supports:
- RGB and CYMK images
- RLE compression
- 8 and 16 bit color depths

This implementation is based on this specification [1] and PHP PSD
Reader [2].

Installing this allows qiv to display PSD images. It should work for
geeqie as well, but seems to have problems.
