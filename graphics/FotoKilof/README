FotoKilof is a Graphical User Interface for ImageMagick and Wand 
that allows, as alternative to command line approach, the processing 
of pictures and other graphic files in JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and (for 
import) SVG formats.

FotoKilof does not give access to the whole functionality of 
ImageMagick, but it supports most of its usual functions and features, 
so may be useful for users that have no familiarity with the shell 
interface to ImageMagick. Also, the preview features allow to prevent 
errors from accidental overwriting of a number of pictures by setting 
incorrect options to ImageMagick commands, i.e. when users crop or 
resize images. 

FotoKilof supports common kinds of graphic conversion like resizing, 
crop, rotation, mirroring, addition of text, logos, borders, 
conversion in other formats, applying of filters or effects (sepia, 
black-white, equalization, contrast increase/decrease, histogram 
stretching, ecc.). For a full information about features and functions 
of FotoKilof please see the home page of the project.

FotoKilof is written in Python and its GUI uses tkinter (already 
included in the Slackware's Python 3 package), the python theme engine 
for Tk, so your system must have the Tk/Tcl platform installed.

The graphic interface supports two different themes: Light (default) 
and Dark. F2 key allows to switch between them at any time.

Versions of FotoKilof more recent than 5.1.1 require at least Python 10
so this version is the latest compatible with Slackware 15.0
