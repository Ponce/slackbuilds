Fyre is a tool for producing computational artwork based on histograms
of iterated chaotic functions. At the moment, it implements the Peter
de Jong map in a fixed-function pipeline with an interactive GTK+
frontend and a command line interface for easy and efficient rendering
of high-resolution, high quality images.
