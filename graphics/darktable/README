Darktable is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers.
It manages your digital negatives in a database and lets you view them
through a zoomable lighttable. It also enables you to develop raw
images and enhance them. This project tries to fill the gap between
the many excellent existing free raw converters and image management
tools (such as ufraw or f-spot).


i686 build

The Darktable project strongly recommends that you should build and run
darktable on x86_64 if possible.  The i686 build will not give you a
satisfactory user experience.  As an absolute minimum, your processor
must support SSE2 instructions (i.e. Pentium 4 or higher, or Athlon 64
or higher).
UPDATE: i*86 looks no more supported, sorry


Optional dependencies

GraphicsMagick - for importing a wide range of non-RAW image formats
flickcurl      - for exporting images to Flickr
colord         - for colour profile management
colord-gtk     - for colour profile management
osm-gps-map    - for map georeferencing
jsonschema     - for checking noise profiles
libavif        - for native AV1 image support
libheif        - for AV1 and HEIF image support

If you have nVidia or AMD/ATI graphics with more than 1Gb of memory,
nvidia-driver (or nvidia-legacy340/304-driver) or amd-app-sdk is an
optional runtime dependency. Darktable will then detect and use the
OpenCL capability of your graphics hardware for faster processing.
See the Darktable User Manual, Section 10.2, for more details (in
particular, if you have an older AMD/ATI graphics card, see Section
10.2.6).
