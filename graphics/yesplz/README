	  "unixporn.com is not porn, it's unix!"


It's a site to post gratuitous screenshots of your desktop so you can
become popular among your friends, or have a place to gawk at cool Linux
desktops when you're stuck at work staring at $OTHER OS.  yesplz is a
command line utility written by sigFLUP that will take a screenshot, tag
your photo, log into unixporn.com, post the picture to your photo album,
and return an ascii bunny on success.

In order for it to work, you must have an account at unixporn.com but
that is free and you can enter nothing but fake information into it.

Then simply run yesplz --help to see the possible tags and instructions
for yesplz.

Enjoy!
