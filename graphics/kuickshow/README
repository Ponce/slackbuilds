KuickShow displays images using all the available space, without being wasted
in bars or menus. It also has a smart automatic zooming that scales images
according to its size. You can use the integrated file browser to choose
images, or navigate through a folder with the mousewheel or the keyboard. It
also has fullscreen view and slideshow, and supports a wide range of image
formats.
