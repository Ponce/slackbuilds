COLLADA(TM) defines an XML-based schema to make it easy to transport 3D assets
between applications - enabling diverse 3D authoring and content processing
tools to be combined into a production pipeline. The intermediate language
provides comprehensive encoding of visual scenes including: geometry, shaders
and effects, physics, animation, kinematics, and even multiple version
representations of the same asset.COLLADA FX enables leading 3D authoring tools
to work effectively together to create shader and effects applications and
assets to be authored and packaged using OpenGL® Shading Language, Cg, CgFX,
and DirectX® FX.

OpenCOLLADA provides COLLADAMax and COLLADAMaya, a new implementation of a
3ds Max or Maya plug-ins to export scene or parts of it to a COLLADA file,
released under an MIT-license. In contrast to other existing COLLADA exporters,
these new plug-ins do not store the COLLADA document in an intermediate data
model but writes it directly to file. This leads to a dramatic reduction of
memory consumption and to much better performance.

This version of OpenCOLLADA uses source code version suitable for building the
latest versions of Blender (2.74 & 2.75a).
