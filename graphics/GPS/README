GIMP Paint Studio is a creative commons set of tool presets,
brush presets, color swatches, patterns, and preset files to provide
even more robust painting and materials-emulation application.
Great for painters and illustrators, but also great for photo
re-touching and airbrushing.

NOTE:
If you're using GIMP as a Flatpak, add ``/usr/share/gimp/2.0/``
to your Folders path in Edit > Preferences > Folder.
You must do this for each item you want GIMP to see (brushes, patterns,
tool presets, and so on).
