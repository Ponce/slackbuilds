# Slackware build script for qiv

# Written by Pablo Santamaria (email removed)

# Modified & now maintained by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>. Original
# version had no license, modified version released under the WTFPL. See
# http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20191231 bkw:
# - Add libopenraw (raw camera image) formats, BUILD=2.
# - Remove mention of wmf-pixbuf loader from README and .sqf
#   since there's a Slackware update that removes the need for it.

# 20191226 bkw:
# - Upgrade for v2.3.2. This was released a month after my last update,
#   but the download page on the site doesn't link to it (found it just
#   now by editing the URL for v2.3.1), so my update-checker script
#   never saw it...
# - As compensation for my tardiness, add support for a bunch of new
#   image types.

# 20170209 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance
# - i486 => i586
# - Add latest fixes from upstream's git
# - Get rid of redundant stripping of binaries and gzipping
#   of man pages (upstream's 'make install' already does it)
# - Don't install README.INSTALL

# Patch to add potential support for various image formats. This patch
# doesn't actually contain any code for decoding/displaying new image
# formats. All it does is add file extensions and magic to the list
# of filetypes qiv will attempt to display via imlib and/or pixbuf.
# It's up to imlib/pixbuf to actually support the image types. Some of
# these are already supported in Slackware, a few require optional deps
# (see README).

# For the optional ones (e.g. webp), this patch doesn't do any harm
# if the support library's not installed. All it does is make qiv warn
# "Unable to read file" on stderr, instead of silently skipping it.

# Three sed expressions here. In order:
# 1. Make qiv build with our compiler flags.
# 2. Disable the test, since it requires X to be running and
#    accepting connections from root.
# 3. Put man page where Slackware likes them.
