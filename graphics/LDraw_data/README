LDraw_data is a package of data-files needed by several utilities based
on LDRAW.

This SlackBuild script compiles a temporary program to create the
index file.  Since it is only needed once, it is not copied to the
created package.

The source file ("complete.zip") is not versioned, but the SlackBuild
checks the version of the data after unzipping.
