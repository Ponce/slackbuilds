GraphicsMagick (Image Processing System)

GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing.
Provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries
which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over
88 major formats including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG,
JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.

Starting with version 1.3.21, this build now includes PerlMagick, the
perl language bindings for GraphicsMagick.

This build can also include Tcl/Tk bindings (TclMagick). To do this,
first 'removepkg GraphicsMagick' if an older version is installed. Then,
run the build script, install the GraphicsMagick package, then run the
build script again and reinstall the (newly-rebuilt) package. This has
to be done on every version upgrade as well (though only if you need
TclMagick, of course).

Optional dependencies: Some file formats require extra libraries. These
are all autodetected at build time.

libwebp (.webp support)
jbigkit (.jbg, .jbig support)
dcraw (Raw camera files, various filename extensions)

Unsupported: These file formats require software that isn't currently
available on SBo. If you submit a build for one of these, please let
me know so I can document it here.

ralcgm (.cgm, Computer Graphics Metafile)
hp2xx (.hpg, .hpgl, HP Graphics Language)
flashpix (.fpx, not supported on Linux)
