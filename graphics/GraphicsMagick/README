GraphicsMagick (Image Processing System)

GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing.
Provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries
which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over
88 major formats including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG,
JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.

If you have an older version of GraphicsMagick installed, it's a good
idea to 'removepkg GraphicsMagick' before building the new version. If
you don't do this, the build might work anyway... Upgrading from 1.3.29
to 1.3.30 has been tested and seems to work, but I make no guarantees.

This build includes PerlMagick (the Perl language bindings for
GraphicsMagick) and TclMagick (Tcl bindings). If you really need to,
you can disable these via PERL=no and/or TCL=no in the environment.

Starting with 1.3.30, GraphicsMagick is built with OpenMP support, which
allows it to take better advantage of multiple cores. If you experience
problems you think might be related to OpenMP, try rebuilding with
OPENMP=no in the environment. Please let the maintainer know if this
actually fixes anything!

Optional dependencies: Some file formats require extra libraries. These
are all autodetected at build time:

jbigkit (.jbg, .jbig support)
dcraw (Raw camera files, various filename extensions)
hp2xx (HP-GL plotter language, .hp and .hpg)
ralcgm (Computer Graphics Metafile, .cgm)
libfpx (FlashPix, .fpx)
