Shotwell is a digital photo organizer for GNOME. It allows the user to import
photos from a digital camera or disk, organize them in various ways, and export
to share with others.

This requires GConf, ORBit2, libgee, libgexiv2, LibRaw, libsoup, libunique, 
vala, icu4c, and webkit.

Kernel options CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS and CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_CLASS will likely
need to be disabled before shotwell recognizes the camera.  We hope that
this will be fixed in the next release of Slackware.  :)
