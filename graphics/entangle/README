Entangle is Open Source software licensed under the GNU GPL v3+.
It is built on top of libgphoto using GTK-3 for its interface. 
It is fully colour managed, auto-detecting system monitor profile and 
applying the neccessary transforms when displaying images.

Entangle provides a graphical interface for “tethered shooting”, 
aka taking photographs with a digital camera completely controlled 
from the computer.
