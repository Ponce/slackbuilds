Tgif is an interactive 2-D drawing facility under X11 based on Xlib.
It supports hierarchical construction of drawings and easy navigation between 
sets of drawings.  It's also a hyper-graphics (or hyper-structured-graphics) 
browser on the World-Wide-Web.

This package includes the QPL-licensed version of Tgif.
