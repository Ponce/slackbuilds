Tgif is an interactive 2-D drawing facility under X11 based on
Xlib.  It supports hierarchical construction of drawings and easy
navigation between sets of drawings.  It's also a hyper-graphics (or
hyper-structured-graphics) browser on the World-Wide-Web.

This package includes the QPL-licensed version of Tgif.
