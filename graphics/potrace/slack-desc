# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

potrace: Potrace (bitmap utility)
potrace:
potrace: Potrace is a utility for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming
potrace: a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM,
potrace: PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the default output is an encapsulated
potrace: PostScript file (EPS).  A typical use is to create EPS files from
potrace: scanned data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes,
potrace: etc.  The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a bitmap, but smooth.
potrace: It can then be rendered at any resolution.
