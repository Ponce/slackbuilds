Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap
into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP
format), and the output is one of several vector file formats.  A typical use
is to create SVG or PDF files from scanned data, such as company or university
logos, handwritten notes, etc.  The resulting image is not "jaggy" like a
bitmap, but smooth.  It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats:  SVG, PDF, EPS,
PostScript, DXF, GeoJSON, PGM (for easy antialiasing of pixel-based images),
Gimppath, and XFig.  Additional backends might be added in the future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to pre-
process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and color images.
