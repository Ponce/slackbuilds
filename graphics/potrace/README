Potrace is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap
into a smooth, scalable image.  The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP
format), and the default output is an encapsulated PostScript file (EPS).  A
typical use is to create EPS files from scanned data, such as company or
university logos, handwritten notes, etc.  The resulting image is not "jaggy"
like a bitmap, but smooth.  It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats:  EPS, PostScript,
PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), DXF, GeoJSON, PGM (for easy antialiasing
of pixel-based images), Gimppath, and XFig.  Additional backends might be
added in the future.

Mkbitmap is a program distributed with Potrace which can be used to pre-
process the input for better tracing behavior on greyscale and color images.
