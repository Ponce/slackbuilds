mcomix (comic book viewer)

MComix is a user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer. It
reads images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image files. It
is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings.

MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes and stability
improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late 2009.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:
You also need either the "unrar" or the "rar" program installed if you wish
to read RAR (.cbr) archives.

Alternatively, MComix can be built over the optional dependency libunrar
from Rarlab.

To read 7Zip archives, you need to have the "7z" program installed. Likewise,
"lha" is needed to open LHA/LZA archives. Note that "7z" can be used as
substitute for both "unrar" and "lha".
