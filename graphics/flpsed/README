flpsed is a WYSIWYG PostScript annotator.  You can't remove or modify 
existing elements of a document, but flpsed lets you add arbitrary 
text lines to existing PostScript documents.  Added lines can later 
be reedited with flpsed.  Using pdftops, which is part of xpdf, one 
can convert PDF documents to PostScript and also add text to them. 
flpsed is useful for filling in forms, adding notes, etcetera.
