Weasis: Free DICOM viewer

A free/libre DICOM viewer

Weasis is a multipurpose standalone and web-based DICOM viewer
designed with a highly modular architecture. It is a very popular
clinical viewer used in healthcare by hospitals, health networks,
multicenter research trials, and by patients.

As free/libre and open source software (FLOSS), Weasis is
cross-platform, multi-language, and supports flexible integration with
PACS, RIS, HIS, or EHR systems. The viewer is compatible with Windows,
Linux, and macOS across various processor architectures (see the
available download packages).

Leveraging the OpenCV library, Weasis delivers high-performance and
high-quality medical imaging renderings.

From version 4 onwards, Weasis features a responsive user interface
aligned with operating system options, offering an enhanced experience
on high-resolution screens.

This is a binary repack.

The runner files are called Weasis (capitalised) and Dicomizer.

This build is bundling its own Java 25.
