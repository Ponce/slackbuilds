# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fritzing: fritzing (electronic prototyping)
fritzing:
fritzing: Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists,
fritzing: researchers and hobbyists to take the step from physical prototyping
fritzing: to actual product. It allows users to document their Arduino and other
fritzing: electronic-based prototypes, and to create a PCB layout for
fritzing: manufacturing.
