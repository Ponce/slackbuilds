fontmatrix is a manager built with the kind of features and abilities
graphic designers, layout professionals along with others have felt
necessary, but modernized with some new touches.

Fontmatrix has a concept of 'tagging'. This makes it really nice to
group fonts and even sub-group them logically for use in a book for
instance. It also has extensive gui support for showing all glyphs
in a font, previews of sample text, variable sizing and also tells
what kinds of advanced Open Type features are inside each font. These
features have never been seen outside of a font editor. And not least,
it creates a nice PDF catalogue of user's fonts for printing or
reference. In short, fontmatrix is a font manager for professionals,
but is nice and user friendly.

This package can make use of the optional dependency podofo: install
it and then pass HAVE_PODOFO="yes" to the slackbuild.
