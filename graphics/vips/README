VIPS is a free image processing system. It includes a range of filters, 
arithmetic operations, colour processing, histograms, and geometric 
transforms. It supports ten pixel formats, from 8-bit unsigned int 
to 128-bit complex. As well as the usual JPEG, TIFF, PNG and WebP images,
it also supports scientific formats like FITS, OpenEXR, Matlab, Analyze, 
PFM, Radiance, OpenSlide and DICOM (via libMagick).
