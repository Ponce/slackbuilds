FreeWRL has had an impressive track record, is here to stay. X3D Components get 
added, problems get resolved. Program with GLSL Shaders using the X3D Shaders 
Component, put your models exactly where you want them with the Geospatial 
Component, or just throw triangles to the screen as Extrusions, IndexedFaceSets,

With royalty free open standards, your models will continue to render, year 
after year.
