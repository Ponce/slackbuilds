Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned
pages. It performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing,
adding/removing borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you
get pages ready to be printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file.
Scanning, optical character recognition, and assembling multi-page
documents are out of scope of this project.
