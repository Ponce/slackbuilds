fbida (image and PDF viewer for framebuffer console)

The fbida project contains a few applications for viewing and 
editing images, with the main focus being photos:

     fbi - This is an image viewer for the Linux framebuffer console.
    fbgs - Script for viewing PS/PDF on framebuffer console using fbi.
  fbipdf - Framebuffer PDF viewer, faster and better than fbgs, but
           without support for PS.
exiftran - Command line tool, lossless transformations of JPEG images.
     ida - Motif based image viewer for X11. Can be disabled by setting
           MOTIF=no in the script's environment.
