fbida (image viewer for framebuffer console)

The fbida project contains a few applications for viewing and 
editing images, with the main focus being photos:

fbi – This is an image viewer for the Linux framebuffer console.
fbgs – Script for viewing ps/pdf files on framebuffer console using fbi.
exiftran – command line tool to do lossless transformations of JPEG images.
 
ida (a Motif based image viewer for X11) is not included on purpose, 
as it needs Open Motif.
