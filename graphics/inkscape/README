Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities 
similar to Illustrator, Freehand, CorelDraw, or Xara X using the W3C 
standard Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format.  Supported SVG 
features include shapes, paths, text, markers, clones, alpha blending, 
transforms, gradients, patterns, and grouping.  Inkscape also supports 
Creative Commons meta-data, node editing, layers, complex path operations, 
bitmap tracing, text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing, and more.
It imports formats such as JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and others and exports PNG 
as well as multiple vector-based formats.
