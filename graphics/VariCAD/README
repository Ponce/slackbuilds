VariCAD is a 3D/2D CAD system primarily intended for mechanical engineering
design.

This builds the trial-version. A license-key must be obtained to use the
program after the 30-day trial period.

This script builds a Slackware package from the official English-language
RPM's.  Other languages are available from VariCAD's download page.
To build the Portuguese version, for example, use:

    # VCLANG=pt ./VariCAD.SlackBuild
