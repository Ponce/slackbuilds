zgv (svgalib picture viewer)

zgv is a picture viewer with a thumbnail-based file selector.
It supports most popular formats and allows panning and fit-to-screen
methods of viewing, slideshows, scaling, gamma adjustment, etc.

By default, the zgv binary is installed suid root, but we have patched
the build to not do this. Instead, we install a udev rules file
that should allow non-root users who belong to the "video" group to
use zgv.  Note that you will have to "modprobe svgalib_helper" prior
to using zgv.

For more information, see zgv's manpage, info files and
/usr/doc/zgv-*/SECURITY.
