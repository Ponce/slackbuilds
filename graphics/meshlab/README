MeshLab is an open source, portable, and extensible system for
the processing and editing of unstructured large 3D triangular
meshes. It is aimed to help the processing of the typical not-so-small
unstructured models arising in 3D scanning, providing a set of tools
for editing, cleaning, healing, inspecting, rendering and converting
this kind of meshes. These tools include MeshLab proper, a versatile
program with a graphical user interface.
