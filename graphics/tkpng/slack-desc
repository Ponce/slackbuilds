# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tkpng: tkpng (PNG photo image support for Tcl/Tk)
tkpng:
tkpng: TkPNG is an open source binary package that adds PNG photo image support
tkpng: to Tcl/Tk. Although other extensions such as Img also add support for
tkpng: PNG images, this package was designed to be lightweight, not depending
tkpng: on libpng nor implementing other image formats, and suitable for
tkpng: inclusion in the Tk core.
