# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

tkpng: tkpng (PNG photo image support for Tcl/Tk) 
tkpng:
tkpng: TkPNG is an open source binary package that adds PNG photo image support
tkpng: to Tcl/Tk. Although other extensions such as Img also add support for
tkpng: PNG images, this package was designed to be lightweight, not depending
tkpng: on libpng nor implementing other image formats, and suitable for
tkpng: inclusion in the Tk core.
