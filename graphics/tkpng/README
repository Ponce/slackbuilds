TkPNG is an open source binary package that adds PNG photo image support to
Tcl/Tk.  Although other extensions such as Img also add support for PNG
images, this package was designed to be lightweight, not depending on libpng
nor implementing other image formats, and suitable for inclusion in the Tk
core.
