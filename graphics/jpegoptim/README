jpegoptim (utility to optimize/compress JPEG files)

jpegoptim is used to optimize/compress jpeg files. It supports
lossless optimization (based on optimizing the Huffman tables) and
so called "lossy" optimization where in addition to optimizing the
Huffman tables, the user can specify an upper limit for image quality,
or a target file size.
