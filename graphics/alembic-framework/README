Alembic is an open computer graphics interchange framework. Alembic
distills complex, animated scenes into a non-procedural, application-
independent set of baked geometric results. This 'distillation' of
scenes into baked geometry is exactly analogous to the distillation
of lighting and rendering scenes into rendered image data.

Alembic is focused on efficiently storing the computed results of
complex procedural geometric constructions. It is very specifically not
concerned with storing the complex dependency graph of procedural tools
used to create the computed results.

HDF5 is an optional dependency autodetected with the support enabled by
default if found in your system. You can disable it passing to the
script an environment variable as following:
   HDF5=no ./alembic-framework.Slackbuild

Warning:
alembic-framework is an optional dependency for Blender autodetected,
but the build of Blender against this dependency works only in current.
The build of Blender 3.3.10 (available in Slackbuilds.org) will fail due
the old version of Imath released in Slackware 15.0, so you have to
uninstall alembic-framework before compilying Blender in stable 15.0.
