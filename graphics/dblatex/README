dblatex (DocBook to LaTeX Publishing)

Dblatex started as a DB2LaTeX clone, but since then many things have
changed and new features have been added or (hopefully) improved. Now,
the portion of shared code is small if any, and the dblatex purpose is
different from DB2LaTeX on these points:
* The project is end-user oriented, that is, it tries to hide as much
  as possible the latex compiling stuff by providing a single clean
  script to produce directly DVI, PostScript and PDF output.
* The actual output rendering is done not only by the XSL stylesheets
  transformation, but also by a dedicated LaTeX package. The goal is to
  allow a deep LaTeX customisation without changing the XSL stylesheets.
* Post-processing is done by Python, to make publication faster,
  convert the images if needed, and do the whole compilation.
