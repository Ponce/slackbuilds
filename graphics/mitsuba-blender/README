Blender plugin enabling you to use the Mitsuba physically-based renderer with Blender.

This SlackBuild assumes that you have installed Blender from SlackBuilds.org
(ie, it is located in /opt rather than /usr/bin or ~/bin).

You can override this assumption with the PLUGINDIR variable:
PLUGINDIR=/path/to/blender/scripts/addons ./exporters_mitsuba-blender.SlackBuild


USING MITSUBA WITH BLENDER
--------------------------

Once installed, you need to activate this plugin within Blender.
To do that, go to Blender > User Preferences > Addons > Renderers
and enable the Mitsuba renderer plugin.

For the PATH TO RENDERER, use /usr/bin (NOT /usr/bin/mitsuba, as you do for povray).
