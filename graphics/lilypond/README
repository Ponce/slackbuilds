LilyPond is a music typesetter.  It produces beautiful
sheet music using a description file as input.

To enable documentation (man and info pages), first install dblatex and a
newer version of texi2html than shipped with Slackware, then run the script as

  # ENABLE_DOCS=yes ./lilypond.SlackBuild

The documentation is disabled by default since SBo's texi2html package
conflicts with Slackware's tetex package.
