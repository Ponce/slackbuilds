MyPaint is a fast and easy open-source graphics application for
digital painters. It lets you focus on the art instead of the
program. You work on your canvas with minimum distractions, bringing
up the interface only when you need it.

It is particularly well-suited for pressure-sensitive input devices,
such as tablets.
