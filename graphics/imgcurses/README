imgcurses (smart character-based image viewer)

imgcurses displays images in a console or terminal using color
ASCII art.

* Do you browse the internet using lynx?
* Do you wish the world was only 8 colors?
* Do you pity your peers with their pathetic desktop applications?

imgcurses might just be for you...

The limited color palette introduces some pretty bad limitations,
but unlike alternatives imgcurses is fully interactive and employs
smart techniques to get the most out of viewing - it doesn't just map
pixel values to ASCII characters. Images are best viewed scaled up,
from a distance, and with a blurred focus. The combination of modes
highlights different image features and makes an overall understanding
of the image much more plausible.
