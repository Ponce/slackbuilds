mitsuba (computer graphics renderer)

Mitsuba is a 3D rendering engine placing emphasis
on experimental rendering techniques.

This SlackBuild is based on a Git commit from 8 March 2022.
It compiles from source code, and installs to /opt with a
symlink to the `mitsuba` binary in `/usr/bin`

## Documentation

To build docs, you must have Sphinx and assorted Sphinx plugins
installed. These are available through `pip`:

```
$ python3 -m pip install sphinx \
    sphinxcontrib-bibtex \
    guzzle_sphinx_theme
```

This SlackBuild doesn't build the docs by default. To enable
the docs, set the `DOCS` variable to `yes` as you build:

```
DOCS=yes sh ./mitsuba2.SlackBuild
```
