fbv (image viewer for framebuffer console)

fbv (FrameBuffer Viewer) is a simple program to view pictures on
a linux framebuffer device. In 2000, when fbv was created, there
were no other suitable programs performing the same task, so the
authors decided to follow the rule: 'If you need a tool - write
it yourself!' :-)
