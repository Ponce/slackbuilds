# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fbv: fbv (image viewer for framebuffer console)
fbv:
fbv: fbv (FrameBuffer Viewer) is a simple program to view pictures on
fbv: a linux framebuffer device. In 2000, when fbv was created, there
fbv: were no other suitable programs performing the same task, so the
fbv: authors decided to follow the rule: 'If you need a tool - write it
fbv: yourself!' :-)
