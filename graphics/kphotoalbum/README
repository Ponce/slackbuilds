KPhotoAlbum (previously known as KimDaBa) is an photograh viewer and
organizer. Users can search for images based on tags (also called
categories). KPhotoAlbum supports KIPI plugins for manipulating images
(these are now included in the optional dependency digikam).

Set DEMO=no to exclude the demo pictures and video from the package.
