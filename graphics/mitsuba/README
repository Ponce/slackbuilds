--------

Mitsuba is a GPLv3 research-oriented rendering system in the style of
PBRT. It is written in C++, implements unbiased as well as biased techniques, 
and contains heavy optimizations targeted towards current CPU
architectures. 

Mitsuba places a strong emphasis on experimental rendering techniques, 
such as path-based formulations of Metropolis Light Transport and 
volumetric modeling approaches.
