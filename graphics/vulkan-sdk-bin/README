This packages the Vulkan SDK binaries for Slackware.

The Vulkan SDK provides the development and runtime components
required to build, run and debug Vulkan applications. This SDK is
based on the Vulkan API header. The SDK also includes certain Vulkan
extensions for window system integration and debug extensions.

The Vulkan API is a low overhead, explicit, cross-platform graphics
API that provides applications with direct control over the GPU,
maximizing performance.

The SDK does not include a Vulkan driver. Please contact your
CPU hardware vendor for a Vulkan Installable Client Driver (ICD).
This SDK will allow you to build Vulkan applications but you will
need a Vulkan driver (ICD) to execute them.

The SDK is only supported on x86_64 systems.
