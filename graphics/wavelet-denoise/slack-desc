# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wavelet-denoise: the wavelet denoise plugin is a tool to reduce noise in each channel
wavelet-denoise: of an image separately.
wavelet-denoise: 
wavelet-denoise: The default colour space to do denoising is YCbCr which has the
wavelet-denoise: advantage that chroma noise can be reduced without affecting image
wavelet-denoise: details. Denoising in CIELAB or RGB is available as an option.
