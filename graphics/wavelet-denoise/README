The wavelet denoise plugin for The GIMP reduces noise in an image using the 
algorithm copied and altered from the UFRaw program. Instead of denoising all 
RGB channels at once, the plugin implementation allows to denoise the RGB 
channels in dividually and - even more useful - to denoise the YCbCr or CIELAB 
channels individually.
