Blender is an integrated suite of free and open source tools enabling
the creation of a broad range of 3D content with the singular
benefits of cross-platform interoperability. It can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast and cinema quality
video. It features fully integrated creation suite, offering a broad
range of essential tools for the creation of 3D content, including
modeling, uv-mapping, texturing, particle and other simulation,
scripting, rendering, compositing, post-production and game creation.

CUDA support is included if cudatoolkit is installed.
It may be disabled by passing CUDA=no when building:
    CUDA=no sh ./Blender.SlackBuild

CUDA support hasn't been thorougly tested, and may break the build. If
so, build with CUDA=no and report a bug to the maintainer of this
script.

Optional dependency: embree. If installed, Blender will be built with
support for it. It may be disabled by passing EMBREE=no when building:
    EMBREE=no sh ./Blender.SlackBuild

Note for 32-bit users: embree is 64-bit only, and can't be built on
32-bit Slackware.

This SlackBuild builds Blender from source code. For Slackware 15.0,
due to its Python 3 version of 3.9.17, the Blender version to be built
is restricted to version 3.3.5.

See also: graphics/blender (note, lowercase B), which repackages the
official Blender x86_64 release binary.
