# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

graph-easy: graph-easy (Convert or render graphs)
graph-easy:
graph-easy: This module lets you create graphs (nodes/vertices connected by
graph-easy: edges/arcs, not pie charts!) and then lay them out on a flat
graph-easy: surface. Once laid out, the graph can be converted into various
graph-easy: output formats like ASCII art, HTML or SVG. You can also output 
graph-easy: the graph in graphviz format and let dot/neato/circo etc. do the
graph-easy: layout for you.
