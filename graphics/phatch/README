Phatch is a simple to use cross-platform GUI Photo Batch Processor
which handles all popular image formats and can duplicate
(sub)folder hierarchies. Phatch can batch resize, rotate, apply
perspective, shadows, rounded corners, ... and more in minutes
instead of hours or days if you do it manually. Phatch allows you to
use EXIF and IPTC tags for renaming and data stamping. Phatch
also supports a console version to batch photos on webservers.
