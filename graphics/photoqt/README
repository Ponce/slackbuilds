Photoqt is a fast, simple, good looking, yet powerful and highly
configurable image viewer.

Support for external software is configured by default with the
following switches:
EXIV2=ON (needs exiv2, by default in Slackware)
PHONON=OFF (needs phonon, by default in Slackware)
GM=OFF (needs GraphicsMagick, optional dependency)
