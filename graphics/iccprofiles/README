Installs popular ICC Profiles from Adobe and ECI for color management.  
Obviously there are many other ICC Profiles available for both 
printers and scanners, but for general purpose color management, these 
are fairly ubiquitous.

Krita features built-in color management; GIMP users may wish to 
install separate+ (also available via SlackBuilds.org) for improved 
color management and better CMYK support.

This script installs both Adobe and ECI profiles by default; exclude 
one or the other by passing ADOBE=no or ECI=no to the SlackBuild.
