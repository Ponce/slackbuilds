Luminance HDR is an HDR imaging tool.  It creates an HDR file from a
set of images (JPEG, TIFF 8 and 16 bit, RAW) of the same scene taken
at different exposure settings.  You can save and load HDR images,
rotate and resize them, tonemap your images, and copy your EXIF data.

Luminance HDR was formerly named qtpfsgui. 

If your target CPU supports SSE2 extensions, you can pass the variable
SSE2=yes to the script:   SSE2=yes sh luminance-hdr.SlackBuild
If in doubt, just let the SlackBuild figure it out for you -- the
default is SSE2=yes on x86_64 only, and SSE2=no on all other ARCHes. 

This requires dcraw and gsl.
