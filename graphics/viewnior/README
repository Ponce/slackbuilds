Viewnior (The Elegant Image Viewer)

This is Viewnior, an image viewer program. Created to be simple, fast
and elegant. Its minimalistic interface provides more screen space for
your images. Viewnior is inspired by big projects like Eye of Gnome,
because of its usability and richness, and by GPicView, because of its
lightweight design and minimal interface.

Viewnior is written in C (GTK+) and uses modified version of the GtkImageView
library by Bjourn Lindqvist.
