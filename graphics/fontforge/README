FontForge is an outline font editor that lets you create your own
postscript, truetype, opentype, cid-keyed, multi-master, cff, svg and
bitmap (bdf, FON, NFNT) fonts, or edit existing ones. It also lets you
convert one format to another. FontForge has support for many Macintosh
font formats.

NOTE: please remove previous version before building new version.
