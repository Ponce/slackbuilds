mtPaint is a painting program which Mark Tyler developed from scratch so
he could easily create pixel art and manipulate digital photos.

It uses the GTK+ toolkit (version 1 or 2) and runs on PC's via the
GNU/Linux or Windows operating systems. Due to its efficient design it
can run on older PC hardware (e.g. a 200MHz CPU and 16MB of free RAM).

mtPaint is free software, which means you are able to freely use, modify
and distribute it according to the GNU General Public License.

Currently mtPaint is maintained by Dmitry Groshev.

If you want internationalization, pass INTL=yes to the SlackBuild.
If you want this built as a gtk1 app, pass GTK1=yes; else it will be
gtk2.
If you want gtk{1,2} widgets then pass TKWIDGETS=yes; else it will use
its own file and color selector widgets.
If you want the handbook installed (about a three meg html book) then
pass HANDBOOK=yes.
