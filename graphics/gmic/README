G'MIC is a full-featured open-source framework for image processing.
It provides several different user interfaces to convert/manipulate/filter/visualize
generic image datasets, ranging from 1d scalar signals to 3d+t sequences of multi-spectral
volumetric images, thus including 2d color images.

This package contains the gimp plug-in.

Note: When building OpenCV, make sure qt5 is not installed, otherwise it will
link against it and caused it fail to build.
