QCAD is an application for computer aided drafting in two dimensions (2d).
With QCAD you can create technical drawings such as plans for buildings,
interiors, mechanical parts or schemas and diagrams.
The source code of the QCAD community edition is released under the GPL (Open
Source).

This script installs the manual in English ("en"), version 2.1.0.0
Other manuals are available on the QCAD site in Czech, German and Hungarian.
To install with these manuals, start the script with:

	MANLANG=xx MANVERSION=a.b.c.d ./qcad.SlackBuild

where xx = "cs", "de" or "hu" and a.b.c.d is the corresponding version.

This requires qt3.

An optional parts library can be built using the qcad-partlibrary package
