libfpx (A library for manipulating FlashPIX images)

FlashPix is a bitmapped computer graphics file format where the image
is saved in more than one resolution. Although this makes it larger
even than a TIFF file of the same resolution, its design anticipated
that when an HTTP request is sent for the file by a browser plugin
implementing the format, only the image compatible with the current
screen resolution is returned to the browser, saving on bandwidth and
download time.

It can be used as an ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick delegate to convert
from FlashPIX format.
