libfpx (A library for manipulating FlashPIX images)

FlashPix is a bitmapped computer graphics file format where the image is
saved in more than one resolution. Although this makes it larger even than
a TIFF file of the same resolution, its design anticipated that when an
HTTP request is sent for the file by a browser plugin implementing the
format, only the image compatible with the current screen resolution is
returned to the browser, saving on bandwidth and download time.

It can be used as an ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick delegate to convert
from FlashPIX format.
