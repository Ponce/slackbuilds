gThumb is an image viewer and browser for the GNOME desktop.  It also
includes an importer tool for transferring photos from cameras.

gThumb supports printing multiple images on a single page using a printer
while many other image viewers don't support it.  Thus, it comes handy.

clutter, libwebp, json-glib, and brasero are optional dependencies.
