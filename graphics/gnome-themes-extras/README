GNOME Themes Extras is a collection of metathemes for the GNOME desktop
environment. This package provides GNOME users an extra set of themes that
are functional and attractive, often sporting a distinct appearance that you
won't find in the primary themes package. Most of the graphics in these Themes
contain SVG vector graphics.
