Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are TrueType
fonts with additional tables containing smart rendering information and
were originally developed to support complex non-Roman writing systems.
They may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, kerning,
justification - this can make them useful even on text written in Roman
writing systems such as English. Note that firefox provides an internal
copy of the graphite engine and cannot use a system version, but it too
should benefit from the availability of graphite fonts.
