OpenCASCADE is a software development platform freely available in open
source. It includes components for 3D surface and solid modelling,
visualization, data exchange and rapid application development.

NOTE: This package needs about 2.5GB of space to build, so adapt your
OUTPUT / TMP variables if necessary.

If you want the complete documentation installed with this (and add about
600MB to the package), start the script with:

  INSTALL_FULL_DOCS=yes ./OpenCASCADE.SlackBuild

This requires ftgl.
FreeImage, libtbb and gl2ps are optional.
