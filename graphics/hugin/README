An easy to use cross-platform panoramic imaging toolchain based on
Panorama Tools. With hugin you can assemble a mosaic of photographs
into a complete immersive panorama, stitch any series of overlapping
pictures and much more.
Since version 2015.0.0 the external lensfun library is replaced by
an internal database. vigra now has to be compiled with OpenEXR
support. And last but not least hugin now ships an own blender tool
which you could use instead of enblend.
