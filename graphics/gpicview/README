A Simple And Fast Image Viewer With Low Memory Usage.  This little program is 
not aimed to be powerful or feature-rich.  It's aimed to replace the default 
image viewer of current desktop systems.  Fast-startup, low memory usage, and 
a simple user interface make it a good choice for default viewer.
