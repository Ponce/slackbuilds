ScreenCloud allows you to take a screenshot using one of the 3 hotkeys 
or simply click the ScreenCloud tray icon.  You can choose where you 
want to save your screenshot.  If you choose to upload your screenshot 
to the screencloud website, a link will automatically be copied to your 
clipboard.  You can share this link with your friends or colleagues via 
email or in an IM conversation.  All they have to do is click the link 
and look at your screenshot.  ScreenCloud also offers FTP and SFTP 
uploading if you want to use your own server.
