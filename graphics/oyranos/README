Oyranos is a Colour Management System (CMS) on operating system level. It
allows to match predictably input device colours to output device colours
accross supporting applications. One goal is to make colour management
useful for all users in a automated fashion and regardless of any technical
knowledge.

Oyranos is based one the well established ICC standard and various other
specifications. System wide settings in Oyranos shall enshure consistency
in a portable fashion. Oyranos will provide in the future a Colour Matching
Module (CMM) framework. Users can then transparently select a desired
colour engine.
