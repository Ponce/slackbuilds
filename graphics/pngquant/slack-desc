# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pngquant: pngquant (PNG conversion tool)
pngquant:
pngquant: pngquant is a command-line utility for converting 24/32-bit PNG
pngquant: images to paletted (8-bit) PNGs.  The conversion reduces file sizes
pngquant: significantly (often as much as 70%) and preserves full alpha
pngquant: transparency.  Generated images are compatible with all modern web
pngquant: browsers, and have better fallback in IE6 than 24-bit PNGs.
