lddot (graphically display shared library dependencies)

lddot is a wrapper over ldd, which produces output in Graphviz format.

Although not strictly required for lddot to run, it's *highly*
recommended to install graphviz and/or graph-easy. One of these will
be required to convert lddot's output into a visible graph.

Examples:

# Replace boxart with ascii, if your terminal doesn't support Unicode.
lddot /bin/bash | graph-easy --as boxart

# This looks like the Death Star.
lddot /usr/bin/xterm | circo -Tpng > graph.png

Note: the example in the man page requires a terminal at least 120
columns wide, to format correctly.
