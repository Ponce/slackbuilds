LuxRender
=========

LuxRender is a physically based and unbiased rendering engine.
Based on state of the art algorithms, LuxRender simulates the flow of light according
to physical equations, thus producing realistic images of photographic quality.
It is fully-featured, with a command line application as well as a GUI, widespread
render farm support, instancing, volumetrics, motion blur, and more.

This package supports 64-bit systems only, because it installs the pre-compiled LuxRender
package. It is possible to install LuxRender on 32-bit system, but it requires building from source.


Optional Depencencies:
------------
opencl-headers
cudatoolkit
nvidia-driver

Install Options:
----------------
To install without OpenCL support, launch this script like this:

$ OPENCL=no ./luxrender.SlackBuild

Blender Plugin
--------------
By default, this SlackBuild:
1. Attempts to auto-detect where your Blender install is by grepping /var/log/packages
2. Attempts to install the Blender plugin to that location

If you do not want it to attempt to do this, do:

$ BLENDER=no ./luxrender.SlackBuild

The Blender plugin will be copied to /usr/share/luxrender-VERSION

If you do have Blender, but in a different path than the SlackBuild.org path,, or not
listed in /var/log/packages for some reason, then you can hardcode the path:

$ BLENDER=/path/to/blender/scripts ./luxrender.SlackBuild

IMPORTANT: Point to your Blender **scripts** directory.
