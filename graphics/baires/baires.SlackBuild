# - use archive.org URLs in .info file
# - install shipped HTML docs, have the Help option use
#   them instead of upstream's site (which no longer exists)
# - use 128px icon instead of 48px
# - make .desktop file validate
# - minor script cleanups

# 20211217 bkw: turned out to be fairly trivial to port this to qt5.

# The patch also removes the 'Ruski' option from the Language
# dropdown, since the Cyrillic characters in the source somehow got
# mojibaked into a bunch of question marks. What appears to have
# happened: the original translations.cpp file was either UTF-8, or
# a mix of ISO-8859-1 and whatever Cyrillic encoding the translator
# used... and someone converted it to ISO-8859-1 (on purpose, or by
# using a crappy editor that silently converted it). The only ways to
# fix this would be to either find an older version of baires from
# before the corruption (unlikely, since upstream's site is long
# dead) or find someone who knows Russian and is willing to redo the
# translation.
