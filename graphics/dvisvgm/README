dvisvgm is a fast DVI (and EPS) to SVG converter

The command-line utility dvisvgm is a tool for TeX/LaTeX users. It
converts DVI and EPS files to the XML-based scalable vector graphics
format SVG. The latest releases support standard DVI files (format 2) as
well as DVI output created by pTeX in vertical mode (format 3), and XeTeX
(format 5 and 6, also known as XDV).

dvisvgm version 1.6 is present in SlackBuild texlive-2014052
This separate package presents an updated version 1.11 of dvisvgm
offereing various bugfixes and the following main features:
* Complete font support including virtual fonts, evaluation of font
encodings, CMap files, sub-font definitions and font maps.
* Glyph outlines of all required fonts are embedded into the generated
SVG files.
* Glyph outlines of fonts that are not available in a vector format are
generated on-the-fly by vectorizing METAFONT's bitmap output.
* dvisvgm allows to replace font definitions by paths so that
applications without SVG font support are enabled to render dvisvgm's
output properly.
* Computes tight bounding boxes for the generated graphics, but supports
common paper formats and arbitrary user-defined sizes as well.
* Option --eps allows to convert EPS files to SVG.
* Intersections of clipping paths can be computed directly instead of
delegating this task to the SVG renderer. This increases the
compatibility of the generated SVG files.
* Approximates PostScript color gradient fills not directly supported by
SVG 1.1.
* Optionally creates compressed SVGZ files.
* Provides options for applying page transformations, like translation,
rotation, scaling, and skewing.
* Evaluates color, emTeX, tpic, hyperref/HyperTeX, PDF mapfile, and
PostScript specials.
