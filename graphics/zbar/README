ZBar Bar Code Reader is an open source software suite for reading bar
codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files, and raw
intensity sensors.  It supports EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128,
Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5, and QR Code.  Included with the library
are basic applications for decoding captured bar code images and using
a video device (e.g. webcam) as a bar code scanner.  For application
developers, language bindings are included for C, C++, Python, and Perl,
as well as GUI widgets for Qt, GTK, and PyGTK.

If you want to enable reading from video stream, pass VIDEO=yes to the
build script when executing it.
