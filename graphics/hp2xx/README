hp2xx (vector graphics conversion)

The hp2xx program is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented graphics
data given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL plotter language into a variety
of popular graphics formats, both vector- and raster-oriented.

The various supported output formats include Encapsulated PostScript
(EPS), PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to facilitate the generation
of graphics within TeX documents. In addition, hp2xx output is printable
on the HP Laserjet/Deskjet printer series, and it may be used as a HP-GL
previewer on many platforms.

It can be used as an ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick delegate to convert
from HPGL format.

Note: hp2xx is built here without PNG output support because it's not
compatible with modern libpng. If you need to convert HP-GL to PNG,
use GraphicsMagick, built with hp2xx support.
