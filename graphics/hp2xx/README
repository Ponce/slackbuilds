hp2xx (vector graphics conversion)

The hp2xx program is a versatile tool to convert vector-oriented
graphics data given in Hewlett-Packard's HP-GL plotter language into a
variety of popular graphics formats, both vector- and raster-oriented.

The various supported output formats include Encapsulated PostScript
(EPS), PCX, IMG, and several formats intended to facilitate the
generation of graphics within TeX documents. In addition, hp2xx output
is printable on the HP Laserjet/Deskjet printer series, and it may be
used as a HP-GL previewer on many platforms.

It can be used as an ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick delegate to convert
from HPGL format.

Note: hp2xx is built here without PNG output support because it's not
compatible with modern libpng. If you need to convert HP-GL to PNG,
use GraphicsMagick, built with hp2xx support.
