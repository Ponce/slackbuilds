Enblend combines images that overlap into a single large image with no seams.
Enfuse combines images that overlap into a single image with good exposure
and good focus. Both programs assume that your images are already lined up.
To make panoramas with Enblend and/or Enfuse, use Hugin.

This requires libxmi.
