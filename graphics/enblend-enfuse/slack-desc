enblend-enfuse: 
enblend-enfuse: Enblend combines images that overlap into a single large image
enblend-enfuse: with no seams. Enfuse combines images that overlap into a
enblend-enfuse: single image with good exposure and good focus. Both programs
enblend-enfuse: assume that your images are already lined up. To make
enblend-enfuse: panoramas with Enblend and/or Enfuse, use Hugin.
