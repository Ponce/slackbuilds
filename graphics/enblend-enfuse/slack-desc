# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

enblend-enfuse: Enblend combines images that overlap into a single large image
enblend-enfuse: with no seams. Enfuse combines images that overlap into a
enblend-enfuse: single image with good exposure and good focus. Both programs
enblend-enfuse: assume that your images are already lined up. To make
enblend-enfuse: panoramas with Enblend and/or Enfuse, use Hugin.
