veles (A new age tool for binary analysis)

It is a very difficult task for a human to notice subtle patterns in
large amounts of binary data, however, us humans are very good at
finding patterns in images.

Statistical visualizations let you find the important bits in a sea of
binary data - all at a glance.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. YMMV on whether
this is a good idea.
