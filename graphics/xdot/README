xdot.py is an interactive viewer for graphs written in Graphviz's dot
language.

It uses internally the graphviz's xdot output format as an intermediate
format, and PyGTK and Cairo for rendering.

xdot.py can be used either as a standalone application from command
line, or as a library embedded in your python application.

Features:
 * Since it doesn't use bitmaps, it is fast and has a small memory
   footprint.
 * Arbitrary zoom.
 * Keyboard/mouse navigation.
 * Supports events on the nodes with URLs.
 * Animated jumping between nodes.
 * Highlights node/edge under mouse.
