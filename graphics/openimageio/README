OpenImageIO is a library for reading and writing images, and a bunch
of related classes, utilities, and applications.  There is a
particular emphasis on formats and functionality used in professional,
large-scale animation and visual effects work for film.

OpenImageIO is used extensively in animation and VFX studios all
over the world, and is also incorporated into several commercial
products.

This package includes options for including a python3 module. Due to
lack of python3 modules in the standard Slackware boost package,
these options are quietly ignored but are maintained in the hope of
future python3 support in Slackware's boost.
