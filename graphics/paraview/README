ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
application. ParaView users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their
data using qualitative and quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be
done interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
processing capabilities.

This SlackBuild, in line with official Paraview releases,
is intended only for 64bit systems.

Although not recommended, building without MPI (mpich) support
is possible by setting the relevant variables in the build environment e.g.
    MPICH=no sh paraview.SlackBuild
