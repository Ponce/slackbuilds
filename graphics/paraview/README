ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and
visualization application. ParaView users can quickly build
visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and
quantitative techniques. The data exploration can be done
interactively in 3D or programmatically using ParaView's batch
processing capabilities.

This SlackBuild, in line with official Paraview releases,
is intended only for 64bit systems.

Although not recommended, building without MPI (mpich) support
is possible by setting the relevant variables in the build environment:

    MPICH=no sh paraview.SlackBuild
