Gallium Nine allows to run any Direct3D 9 application with nearly no CPU
overhead, which provides a smoother gaming experience and increased FPS.

Gallium Nine Standalone, as the name implies, is a standalone version of
the WINE parts of Gallium Nine.

This decouples Gallium Nine from the WINE tree, so that it can be used
with any WINE version. There is no need for any WINE patches. A stable,
development, or staging WINE release is sufficient.

wine-nine-standalone can only be used with gallium drivers provided by
mesa, this includes nouveau, r600 and radeonsi users.

To enable 64-bit support wine must be built with wine64.

  WIN64=yes ./wine.SlackBuild

To build on a pure Slackware64 install 32-bit wine must be disabled.

  WIN32=no WIN64=yes ./wine.SlackBuild
