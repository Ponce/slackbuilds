GLiv is an OpenGL image viewer, image loading is done via Gdk-pixbuf bundled
with GTK+-2.6, rendering with OpenGL and the graphical user interface uses GTK+
with GtkGLExt. GLiv is very fast and smooth at rotating, panning and zooming
if you have an OpenGL accelerated graphics board. It supports thumbnails and
navigating through them using two images menus and a browser.
