GLiv is an OpenGL image viewer, image loading is done via Gdk-pixbuf
bundled with GTK+-2.6, rendering with OpenGL and the graphical user
interface uses GTK+ with GtkGLExt. GLiv is very fast and smooth
at rotating, panning and zooming if you have an OpenGL accelerated
graphics board. It supports thumbnails and navigating through them
using two images menus and a browser.
