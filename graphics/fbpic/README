FBpic is a simple command to view ppm files on the linux frame buffer.
There are no command line switches, the ppm file is just read in from
stdin.  You must have your framebuffer set up to display graphics (@16bpp).


EXAMPLES:

To display the image /fancyboot/images/main.ppm on the console:

  cat '/fancyboot/images/main.ppm'|fbpic

To scale and display a jpg on the console via Imagemagik:

  convert /fancyboot/images/ntpd.png -scale 1024x768! ppm:-|fbpic

Simple one line slideshow:

  setterm -cursor off;find /path/to/pics/*.jpg|while read; \
  do convert -scale 1024x768! ppm:-|fbpic;sleep 2;done;setterm -cursor on

Change "scale" to your frame buffer resolution, change /path/to/pics/
to point to a folder of jpgs and sleep for the delay.
