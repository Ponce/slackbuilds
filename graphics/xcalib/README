Xcalib is a simple application to set ICC color profiles.
This is frequently required in professional graphic and VFX
environments to maintain consistent color throughout the production pipeline.


BUILDING
========
By deault, this SlackBuild script builds the 'xcalib' target, 
suitable for Intel and Nvidia graphic processors.

If you want to build xcalib for use with AMD proprietary
FGLRX drivers, start the build script with a leading variable:

GPU=fglrx ./xcalib.SlackBuild

** Not having access to an AMD GPU, this is UNTESTED.


ICC PROFILES
============
Sample ICC profiles are included with this build, but you should use an
ICC profile for your monitor created by a spectrometer.
An open source spectrometer is available from http://www.hughski.com/

Common industry ICC profiles from Adobe and the ECC are available
in the iccprofiles package here on SlackBuilds.org


USAGE
=======
Using xcalib is as simple as:
xcalib display :0 /usr/share/color/icc/foo.icc

To make that automatic, add that line to your .xinitrc file.
