digiKam is a simple digital photo management application for KDE,
which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap". The
photos can be organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically,
by directory layout or by custom collections. An easy to use interface
is provided that enables you to connect to your camera and preview,
download and/or delete your images.

eigen3, enblend-enfuse, hugin, sqlite2, libdc1394 and QtGStreamer are optional dependencies.

NOTE:
- digikam now ships with its own internal version of kipi-plugins.
- please remove previous version before building the current version.
- Make sure qt5 is not installed before building opencv or else digiKam will segfault.
