Resynthesizer is a Gimp plug-in for texture synthesis. Given a sample
of a texture, it can create more of that texture. This has a surprising
number of uses:

    * Creating more of a texture
      (including creation of tileable textures)

    * Removing objects from images
      (great for touching up photos)

    * Creating themed images

This plug-in installs itself in the Filters/Map menu as "Resynthesize".
It generates a texture based on a sample image of the texture. The
result can be made to fit the boundary pixels of a region, or to have
a specified arrangement of features.

Also included in this package are some scripts that use Resynthesizer:

  Filters/Enhance/Smart enlarge 
  Filters/Enhance/Smart sharpen
  Filters/Enhance/Smart remove selection
