geopy makes it easy for developers to locate the coordinates of
addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using
third-party geocoders and other data sources.

geopy currently includes support for several geocoders, including
OpenStreetMap Nominatim, ESRI ArcGIS, Google Geocoding API and more.

python3-pytz and python3-aiohttp are optional dependencies that
will be used if available.
