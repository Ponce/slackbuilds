geopy makes it easy for developers to locate the coordinates of addresses,
cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party
geocoders and other data sources.

geopy currently includes support for several geocoders, including OpenStreetMap
Nominatim, ESRI ArcGIS, Google Geocoding API and more.

python/pytz, python/python-requests and python/python3-aiohttp are optional
dependencies that will be used if available (they must all be built with
Python 3 support).
