System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is a Geographic 
Information System software with immense capabilities for geodata 
processing and analysis.

SAGA supports the implementation of new functions with an effective 
API. Functions are organised as modules in framework independent 
Module Libraries and can be accessed via SAGA's Graphical User 
Interface or various scripting environments (shell scripts, Python, 
R and so on).

SAGA can use these optional autodetected dependencies enabled if they 
are found in the system: 
libharu, OpenMP, OpenCV, qhull, vigra, pdal, postgresql/postgis, 
libLAS, proj, hdf5. Previous issues given with OpenCV version 4 or 
greater and vigra seem solved in last versions of SAGA.

WARNINGS:
1) Unlike earlier versions of SAGA, the build of last versions 
   requires wxGTK3 => 3.1 that is not available in Slackbuilds.org at 
   the moment. If you want to build this version of SAGA you have to 
   install the package wxWidgets (also available in Slackbuilds.org).
   If you have both wxGTK3 and wxWidgets installed in your system,
   make sure that wxWidgets is installed after wxGTK.
2) SAGA requires an ODBC driver in the system. It works both with
   iODBC (installed with the libiodbc package (included in Slackware
   15.0) and unixODBC (installed from the SBo's slackbuild). The build
   first searches for unixODBC then for iODBC.
3) unixODBC is a required dependency in 32 bit systems since the
   libiodbc headers cause a build failure during the compilation.
