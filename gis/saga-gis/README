System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) is a Geographic Information
System software with immense capabilities for geodata processing and analysis.

SAGA supports the implementation of new functions with an effective API.
Functions are organised as modules in framework independent Module Libraries
and can be accessed via SAGA's Graphical User Interface or various scripting
environments (shell scripts, Python, R and so on).

SAGA can use these optional dependencies: postgresql, opencv and vigra.
