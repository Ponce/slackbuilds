WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial data analysis platform developed by
Prof. John Lindsay at the University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and
Hydrogeomatics Research Group. WhiteboxTools can be used to perform common
geographical information systems (GIS) analysis operations, such as
cost-distance analysis, distance buffering, and raster reclassification. Remote
sensing and image processing tasks include image enhancement (e.g. panchromatic
sharpening, contrast adjustments), image mosaicing, numerous filtering
operations, simple classification (k-means), and common image transformations.
WhiteboxTools also contains advanced tooling for spatial hydrological analysis
(e.g. flow-accumulation, watershed delineation, stream network analysis, sink
removal), terrain analysis (e.g. common terrain indices such as slope,
curvatures, wetness index, hillshading; hypsometric analysis; multi-scale
topographic position analysis), and LiDAR data processing. LiDAR point clouds
can be interrogated (LidarInfo, LidarHistogram), segmented, tiled and joined,
analyized for outliers, interpolated to rasters (DEMs, intensity images), and
ground-points can be classified or filtered. WhiteboxTools is not a
cartographic or spatial data visualization package; instead it is meant to
serve as an analytical backend for other data visualization software, mainly
GIS.
