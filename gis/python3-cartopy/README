Cartopy is a Python package designed to make drawing maps for data analysis an
visualisation as easy as possible.

Some of the key features of cartopy are:

* object oriented projection definitions
* point, line, polygon and image transformations between projections
* integration to expose advanced mapping in matplotlib with a simple and
  intuitive interface
* powerful vector data handling by integrating shapefile reading with shapely
  capabilities
