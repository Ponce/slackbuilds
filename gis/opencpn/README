OpenCPN is a free software (GPLv2) project to create a concise chart
plotter and navigation software, for use underway or as a planning
tool. OpenCPN is developed by a team of active sailors using real
world conditions for program testing and refinement.

If you are upgrading or installing new, OpenCPN 5.2.x needs wxGTK3
to be built with webkit support.  So you will have to install
webkit2gtk, available here at SBo, then build and install wxGTK3.
