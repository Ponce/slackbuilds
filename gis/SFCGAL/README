SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around CGAL, written with the aim of
supporting ISO 19107:2013 and OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D
operations.

This package contains a version of SFCGAL greater than 1.4.0.

OpenSceneGraph is an optional dependency enabled by default if found
in your system. If you do not need this, pass the environment variable
to the script:
   OSG=no ./SFCGAL.SlackBuild

Warning.
Since version 1.4.1, SFCGAL depends on CGAL version 5.3 or greater.
To install or upgrade SFCGAL you must uninstall the package CGAL
(based on version 4.x) then install CGAL5.

CGAL5 conflicts with CGAL, hence they cannot be installed at the same
time. Since other packages depends on CGAL versions earlier than 5.0
you may want to keep a version supported by these. In this case, you
have to install SFCGAL-legacy, also available in this repository and
depending on CGAL version 4.x.
