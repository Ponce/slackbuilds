google-earth (Google's famous virtual globe)

Google Earth is a virtual globe program. It maps a version of the
Earth by the superimposition of images obtained from satellite 
imagery, aerial photography and GIS over a 3D globe. You point 
and zoom to any place on the planet that you want to explore.
Satellite images and local facts zoom into view. Tap into Google
search to show local points of interest and facts. Zoom to a 
specific address to check out an apartment or hotel. View driving
directions and even fly along your route.

The degree of resolution available is based somewhat on the points 
of interest, but most land (except for some islands) is covered in at 
least 15 meters of resolution. 

When running GoogleEarth for the first time, you will see an error
message stating that it is unable to find the Bitstream Vera fonts.
This should be safe to ignore - it will use other fonts (and the
DejaVu fonts included with Slackware are based on the Bitstream fonts).

NOTES:
1) Google Earth 7 is "LSB compliant" meaning it was built on a LSB
   system.  Slackware however does not have that symlink which is part
   of the LSB 3.0 specification.  Before, you had to add that symlink
   manually; that is now handled in doinst.sh.

2) Google Earth sometimes crashes when the 65-fonts-persian.conf is
   available on the system. If you experience crashes, try removing
   /etc/fonts/conf.d/65-fonts-persian.conf prior to launching this
   application. The easiest way to do this is:

            mv /etc/fonts/conf.d/65-fonts-persian.conf \
               /etc/fonts/conf.d/65-fonts-persian.conf.old

3) GoogleEarth requires that you have OpenGL drivers installed on your
   system (and Xorg configured to use them). Not doing so will cause X
   to crash.

4) This is the legacy version 7.3.0, which is confirmed to run on
   Slackware 14.2.  The newer versions (7.3.1 and later) tend to hang
   on 14.2.  On startup, a nag screen will pop up advising you that a
   new version is availble, which you can safely ignore.
