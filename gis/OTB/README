ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image
processing algorithms. OTB is based on the medical image processing library ITK
and offers particular functionalities for remote sensing image processing in
general and for high spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted
algorithms for high resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird,
WorldView, Landsat, Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion) or SAR
(TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are available.

OTB may use the following optional dependency: opencv (use OPENCV=on).

If the following packages are installed OTB will be built and linked against
them: muParser, OpenSceneGraph and tinyxml. Otherwise, internal copies of the
code will be used.
