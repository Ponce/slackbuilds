ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image processing algorithms.
OTB is based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers particular
functionalities for remote sensing image processing in general and for high
spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted algorithms for high
resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat,
Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are
available.

Monteverdi, a satellite image viewer with access to OTB processing, will also
be built if MONTEVERDI=ON is passed to the script. This will require the qwt
package to be installed.

A QT application launcher will be built by default. Set QTGUI=OFF to disable
it (note that disabling Qt support will also disable Monteverdi even if
MONTEVERDI is set to ON).

OTB may use the following optional dependencies: opencv (use OPENCV=ON).

OTB will be built with support for the following packages if they are
available at compile time: numpy and numpy3.
