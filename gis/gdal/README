GDAL is a library for reading and writing raster geospatial data
formats, and is released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by
the Open Source Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a
single abstract data model to the calling application for all
supported formats. It may also be built with a variety of useful
command-line utilities for data translation and processing.

The related OGR library (which is part of the GDAL source tree)
provides a similar capability for simple features vector data.

The following optional requirements are detected automatically:
cfitsio, freexl, hdf, hdf5, libwebp, netcdf, postgresql, xerces-c

To enable OpenCL GPU-accelerated performance, specify the option
OPENCL=yes (requires opencl-headers to build, and either nvidia-driver
or amd-app-sdk with suitable GPU hardware to run).
