PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially
enables" the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a
backend spatial database for geographic information systems
(GIS).

SFCGAL is an optional dependency for advanced 3D support. 

To disable the GTK-based graphical interface for shp2pgsql,
set GUI=no.

To include the shp2pgsql plugin for pgAdmin set PGADMIN=yes.
