Tryton is a complete ERP. The main features are accounting (analytic
and financial), stock management, sales and purchases management,
POS, etc. Technical features include a distributed server, flexible
workflows, an object database, a dynamic GUI, customizable reports, and
SOAP and XML-RPC interfaces.

Optional dependency: Sphinx (autodetected). Required for building the
HTML documentation (/usr/doc/trytond-*/html/).

To add modules, you will need pip.

Before you can use the tryton server, you will have to set up
postgresql. All you have to do is issue the following command:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser tryton

This will setup trytond for use with postgresql on localhost.  There is
no need to set a password on localhost. However, if you are going to
run postgresql on a different server, you will have to run createuser
like this:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser -P tryton

After initializing postgres, modify /etc/trytond/trytond.conf to match
your local setup. After trytond is setup, then you can run
    /etc/rc.d/rc.trytond start

If you want to install the documentation, optional dependency is Sphinx
documentation program (development/Sphinx).

For a list of modules that can be added to trytond, at cli type:
    pip search trytond

then to add module, type:
    pip install trytond_module_name

where trydond_module_name is the name of the module. For example, to
add the account package, type:
    pip install trytond_account
