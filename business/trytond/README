Tryton is a complete ERP. The main features are accounting (analytic
and financial), stock management, sales and purchases management,
POS, etc. Technical features include a distributed server, flexible
workflows, an object database, a dynamic GUI, customizable reports, and
SOAP and XML-RPC interfaces.

To add modules, you will need pip.

Before you can use the tryton server, you will have to set up
postgresql. All you have to do is issue the following command:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser tryton

This will setup trytond for use with postgresql on localhost.  There is
no need to set a password on localhost. However, if you are going to
run postgresql on a different server, you will have to run createuser
like this:
  createuser -U postgres --createdb --no-adduser -P tryton

After initializing postgres, modify /etc/trytond/trytond.conf to match
your local setup. After trytond is setup, then you can run
    /etc/rc.d/rc.trytond start

If you want to install the documentation, optional dependency is Sphinx
documentation program (development/Sphinx).

For a list of modules that can be added to trytond, at cli type:
    pip search trytond

then to add module, type:
    pip install trytond_module_name

where trydond_module_name is the name of the module. For example, to
add the account package, type:
    pip install trytond_account
