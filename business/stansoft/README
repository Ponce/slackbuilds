Stansoft is Linux financial accounting software for business. It
uses a PostgreSQL database, which is included. You can optionally
use an IBM Informix Innovator-C database, which can be downloaded
free of charge from IBM. There is no limit on the number of users
per installation, which allows for scalability from small to large
companies. The user interface is ncurses / terminal based to optimize
data entry efficiency. It can be run locally or deployed remotely on a
virtual cloud server.

You must have a stansoft user and group to run this script:
# groupadd -g 325 stansoft
# useradd -u 325 -g 325 -c \"Stansoft user\" -s /bin/bash stansoft

If you wish to use IBM Informix, please add an informix user and group
as well:
# groupadd -g 326 informix
# useradd -u 326 -g 326 -c \"Informix user\" -s /bin/bash informix

NOTES:
1) After installing the Slackbuild you must run the Stansoft
   installation script /opt/stansoft/install

2) Installation and setup help can be found in /opt/stansoft/README and
   the manual is located at /opt/stansoft/doc/ssmanual.pdf

3) stansoft and informix are the database administrator account, so
   please set a strong password for it.
