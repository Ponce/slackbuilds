7PLUS is an encoder vaguely similar to Unix's UUENCODE.
It uses a very effective radix216 encoding and incorporates
diverse mechanisms to ensure decoded data is not corrupted.
It also includes an interactive repair mechanism which allows
the repair of damaged files using correction files, thus
eliminating the need to retransmit entire files. In case of
a corruption, only the faulty sections are resent. 7PLUS
is only meant to be used within the Packet Radio network
for the tranport of binary data through Packet Radio mail.
It cannot be used for Internet eMail since it needs a
(almost) transparent path from end to end.

This will not build on x86_84, patches welcome.
