This program uses a free XML feed from the HamQTH.com website of Petr,
OK2CQR. His callsign database has over 1.3 million callsigns and is very
fast, returning the station information in just a few seconds. Thanks to
Petr for a great service.

Given a ham radio callsign, twHamQTH will display the name, address,
city and country of the station. All of the station data can be use by
other programs.

You'll need a free HamQTH.com login to use this software.
