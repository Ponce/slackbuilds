lpsk31 is a ncurses console application for ham radio communications in
the popular PSK31 digital mode. lpsk31 uses only integer arithmetic for
both signal detection and audio tone synthesis, so that it needs no
floating point calculations for its operation.

lpsk31 can keep a log of QSO's in text and ADIF format as well as a raw
log of all that is typed in the transmit window or displayed in the
receive window. Some QSO data (signal strength and frequency) can be
acquired automatically via a CAT interface from the transceiver itself,
if it is an FT847. Unfortunately there is no CAT for other types of
transceiver since I had problems using Hamlib.
