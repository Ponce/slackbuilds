WSJT-X ("Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT") offers specific digital
protocols optimized for EME (moonbounce), meteor scatter, and
ionospheric scatter, at VHF/UHF, as well as for LF, MF, and HF
propagation.

The program can decode fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from
ionized meteor trails and steady signals more than 10 dB below the
audible threshold.  WSJT-X incorporates nearly all popular capabilities
of programs WSJT and WSPR, while adding comprehensive rig control and
many other features.  Check the WSJT-X page and links therein for
details about modes FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, QRA64, ISCAT, MSK144, and
WSPR.
