WSJT-X ("Weak Signal Communication, by K1JT") offers specific digital protocols
optimized for EME (moonbounce), meteor scatter, and ionospheric scatter, at
VHF/UHF, as well as for LF, MF, and HF propagation.  The program can decode
fraction-of-a-second signals reflected from ionized meteor trails and steady
signals more than 10 dB below the audible threshold.  WSJT-X incorporates nearly
all popular capabilities of programs WSJT and WSPR, while adding comprehensive
rig control and many other features.  Check the WSJT-X page and links therein
for details about modes FT4, FT8, JT4, JT9, JT65, QRA64, ISCAT, MSK144, and
WSPR.
