The SvxLink project is developing a flexible, general purpose voice
services system for ham radio use.

This package provides a set of sound files for use with svxlink.  It's a
repackage of the original distribution for Slackware.

To use this package as the default language add the following symlink:

ln -s /usr/share/svxlink/sounds/en_US-heather-16k/ \
      /usr/share/svxlink/sounds/en_US
