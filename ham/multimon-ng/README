multimon-ng: multimon-ng (digital radio transmission decoder)

The successor to multimon, with support for more modes and improved
compatibility with moderns systems. It decodes the following digital
transmission modes commonly found on VHF/UHF bands:
 POCSAG512 POCSAG1200 POCSAG2400 FLEX EAS UFSK1200 CLIPFSK AFSK1200
 AFSK2400 AFSK2400_2 AFSK2400_3 HAPN4800 FSK9600 DTMF ZVEI1 ZVEI2
 ZVEI3 DZVEI PZVEI EEA EIA CCIR MORSE CW X10
Multiple decoders can run concurrently on the same signal, which is
provided via a file or a pipe. Common setups are: a radio connected
via a sound card (may require modifications to the radio); samples
provided via a GNU Radio sink or the UDP audio stream in gqrx (via
netcat and sox).
