QtTermTCP is a multi-platform version of BPQTermTCP.

It supports TCP access to a bpq32 node either over a local
LAN or the Internet. It connects to the BPQ32 TelnetServer
in FBB mode, so you must define an FBBPORT in the BPQ32
Telnet Configuration.

It can also be used as a terminal for programs like UZ7HO's
Soundmodem that support the AGW API, with KISS TNCs and with
the VARA Modem. KISS TNCs can be connected via a serial port
or a TCP connection.

It can be used with the AGWPE emulator in BPQ32/LinBPQ though
that has no significant advantages over the normal TCP interface.

It supports the YAPP protocol to allow you to send and receive files.

NOTE:
For Packet Radio, use QtSoundModem in conjunction with this terminal.
