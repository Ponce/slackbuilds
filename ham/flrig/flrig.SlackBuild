# Otherwise, you're on your own.  I've tested the script
# on my own computer, and it hasn't broken anything.
# So if it does it on your computer, that falls in
# the realm of "Not my problem."
#
# Of course, if you'll send a bug report to the above
# email address, I may be able to see what you did
# wrong and prevent it from happening in the future.
# In which case, I may just send YOU five dollars.

# Oh, and feel free to copy it and modify it as you
# see fit. Or as I see fit. Or as I fit. Although
# that is unlikely, as I am rather tall.
