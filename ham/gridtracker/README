GridTracker: An Amateur Radio Companion

GridTracker listens to traffic from WSJT-X/JTDX, displays it on a map,
and has a sophisticated alerting and filtering system for finding and
working interesting stations. It also will upload QSO records to
multiple logging frameworks including Logbook of the World.
