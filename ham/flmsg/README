FLMSG - Amateur radio messaging tool

FLMSG is a simple forms management editor for the amateur radio
supported standard message formats. Form data can be transferred between
computers either using standard internet email or via radio frequency
broadcasts typically made by an amateur radio operator on your behalf.
flmsg forms can be very complex and include embedded images and other
controls that make data entry less prone to error.

FLMSG sits on top of FLDIGI, which does the real signal processing.
