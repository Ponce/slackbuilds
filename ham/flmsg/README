FLMSG - Amateur radio messaging tool

FLMSG is a simple forms management editor for the amateur radio supported
standard message formats. Form data can be transferred between computers
either using standard internet email or via radio frequency broadcasts
typically made by an amateur radio operator on your behalf.
flmsg forms can be very complex and include embedded images and other controls
that make data entry less prone to error.

FLMSG sits on top of FLDIGI, which does the real signal processing.
