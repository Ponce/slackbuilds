# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

yagiuda: yagiuda (Yagi-Uda Antenna Analysis Tool)
yagiuda:
yagiuda: Software to analyse performance of Yagi-Uda antennas. This program
yagiuda: allows users to input dimensions and positions of antenna elements
yagiuda: and calculates various performance metrics including gain, input
yagiuda: impedance, front-to-back ratio, and beam-patterns.
yagiuda:
yagiuda: The package includes an optimization tool that can help improve
yagiuda: antenna designs and analyze sensitivity to mechanical errors.
