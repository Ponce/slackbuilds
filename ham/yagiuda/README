yagiuda (Yagi-Uda Antenna Analysis Tool)

yagiuda is a software tool designed to analyze the performance
of Yagi-Uda antennas. By providing the dimensions and positions
of each antenna element, the program calculates various important
metrics including:

- Gain
- Input impedance
- Front-to-back ratio
- Beam patterns

The package includes an optimization program that can help
improve antenna designs and analyze their sensitivity to small
mechanical errors.
