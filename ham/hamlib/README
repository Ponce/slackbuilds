Hamlib (the ham radio control libraries)

Hamlib is a development effort to provide a consistent C language
interface for programmers wanting to incorporate radio controls in their
programs.  Network daemons for radio and rotator control, along with
language bindings for C++, Perl, Python, TCL, and Lua are included.

Optional language bindings

To build either or all of the Perl, Python, or TCL bindings, pass one of
or in combination:

        PL_MOD=yes
        PY_MOD=yes
        TCL_MOD=yes

to the build script.

Optional Lua binding

Also available are bindings for Lua 5.2 or later.  As Lua 5.2 and Lua
5.3 are now available from SlackBuilds.org, once the preferred version
of Lua is installed, the Lua bindings may be built by passing:

           LUA_VER=5.2
           LUA_VER=5.3

to the build script.

Optional Python3 binding (experimental)

For those wishing to experiment with Python3 and Hamlib, bindings may be
built (exclusive of the normal Python2 bindings) by passing:

           PY3_MOD=yes

to the build script.  This option overrides PY_MOD.

While Python allows for version 2 and 3 modules to be installed
concurrently, and while there does exist a method for doing so with
Hamlib, that has not been included in this build script at this time.
If concurrent installation is needed, please contact the build script
maintainer.

All four bindings (either of the Python and either of the Lua versions)
may be passed to the script to enable all bindings at build time.
