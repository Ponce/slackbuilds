Hamlib (the ham radio control libraries)

Hamlib is a development effort to provide a consistent C language interface
for programmers wanting to incorporate radio controls in their programs.
Network daemons for radio and rotator control, along with language bindings
for C++, Perl, Python, TCL, and Lua are included.

Optional language bindings

To build either or all of the Perl, Python, or TCL bindings, pass one of or in
combination:

        PL_MOD=yes
        PY_MOD=yes
        TCL_MOD=yes

to the build script.

Optional Lua binding

Also available are bindings for Lua 5.2 or later.  As Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3 are
now available from SlackBuilds.org, once the preferred version of Lua is
installed, the Lua bindings may be built by passing:

           LUA_VER=5.2
           LUA_VER=5.3

to the build script.

Optional Python3 binding (experimental)

For those wishing to experiment with Python3 and Hamlib, bindings may be built
(exclusive of the normal Python2 bindings) after Python3 is installed
(available from SlackBuilds.org) by passing:

           PY3_MOD=yes

to the build script.  This option overrides PY_MOD.

While Python allows for version 2 and 3 modules to be installed concurrently,
and while there does exist a method for doing so with Hamlib, that has not
been included in this build script at this time.  If concurrent installation
is needed, please contact the build script maintainer.

All four bindings (either of the Python and either of the Lua versions) may be
passed to the script to enable all bindings at build time.
