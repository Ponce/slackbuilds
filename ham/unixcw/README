unixcw is a project providing the libcw library and a set of programs 
using the library: cw, cwgen, cwcp and xcwcp. The programs are intended 
for people who want to learn receiving and sending Morse code. These
include a QT4 code practice program, xcwcp.

unixcw is also needed by some other programs that make use of libcw.
