# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Set-IntSpan: perl-Set-IntSpan (Manages sets of integers)
perl-Set-IntSpan:
perl-Set-IntSpan: Set::IntSpan manages sets of integers. It is optimized for sets that
perl-Set-IntSpan: have long runs of consecutive integers. These arise, for example, in 
perl-Set-IntSpan: .newsrc files, which maintain lists of articles:
perl-Set-IntSpan:
perl-Set-IntSpan: alt.foo: 1-21,28,31
perl-Set-IntSpan: alt.bar: 1-14192,14194,14196-14221
