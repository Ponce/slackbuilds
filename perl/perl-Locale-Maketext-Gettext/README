perl-Locale-Maketext-Gettext

Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext
frameworks. It is a subclass of Locale::Maketext(3) that follows the
way GNU gettext works. It works seamlessly, both in the sense of GNU
gettext and Maketext. As a result, you enjoy both their advantages,
and get rid of both their problems, too.

You start as an usual GNU gettext localization project: Work on PO
files with the help of translators, reviewers and Emacs. Turn them
into MO files with msgfmt. Copy them into the appropriate locale
directory, such as /usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/myapp.mo.

Then, build your Maketext localization class, with your base class
changed from Locale::Maketext(3) to Locale::Maketext::Gettext.
