# 20220301 bkw: if perl-Test-POD was installed, the test "t/3_pods.t" was
# failing, because the .pm files didn't specify an encoding for the
# embedded POD docs, and there's a non-ASCII character in the author's
# name in every file. The easy way to fix it would have been:
#   rm -f t/3_pods.t
# but the *correct* fix is to do this:
sed -i '2i\\n=encoding latin1\n\n=cut\n\n' lib/Config/Find{/*,.pm}
