File::Save::Home - Place file safely under user home directory.

In the course of deploying an application on another user's system, you sometimes need to place
a file in or underneath that user's home directory. Can you do so safely?

This Perl extension provides several functions which try to determine whether you can, indeed,
safely create directories and files underneath a user's home directory.

Among other things, if you are placing a file in such a location only temporarily -- say, for
testing purposes -- you can temporarily hide any already existing file with the same name and
restore it to its original name and timestamps when you are done.
