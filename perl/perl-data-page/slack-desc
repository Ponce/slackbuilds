# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-data-page: perl-data-page (help when paging through sets of results)
perl-data-page:
perl-data-page: When searching through large amounts of data, it is often the case
perl-data-page: that a result set is returned that is larger than we want to display
perl-data-page: on one page.
perl-data-page: This results in wanting to page through various pages of data.
perl-data-page: The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, hence this module.
