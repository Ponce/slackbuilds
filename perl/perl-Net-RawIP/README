Net::RawIP - Perl extension to manipulate raw IP packets with interface to
libpcap.

This package provides a class which can be used for creating, manipulating and
sending raw IP packets with optional features for manipulating Ethernet
headers.
As its name implies, this module is quite low-level, and currently duplicates
some features with Net::Pcap. If you prefer a higher-level module (in terms of
Perl support), please take a look at Net::Write, which provides a portable
interface to construct and send raw packets on the network.
