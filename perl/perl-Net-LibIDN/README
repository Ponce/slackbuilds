Net::LibIDN - Perl bindings for GNU Libidn

Provides bindings for GNU Libidn, a C library for handling
Internationalized Domain Names according to IDNA (RFC 3490), in a way
very much inspired by Turbo Fredriksson's PHP-IDN. There is currently
no support for Perl's unicode capabilities (man perlunicode). All input
strings are assumed to be octet strings, all output strings are generated
as octet strings. Thus, if you require Perl's unicode features, you will
have to convert your strings manually. For example:

 use Encode;
 use Data::Dumper;
 print Dumper(Net::LibIDN::idn_to_unicode('xn--uro-j50a.com', 'utf-8'));
 print Dumper(decode(
       'utf-8', Net::LibIDN::idn_to_unicode('xn--uro-j50a.com', 'utf-8')));
