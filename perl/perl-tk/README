perl-tk (Tk graphical interface for Perl)

Perl/Tk is an extension for writing Perl programs with a GUI.

Tk was originally developed as an extension to the Tcl language
for use with the X Window System on Unix.  With its port to perl,
Tk gives Perl programmers the same control over the graphical
desktop that Tcl programmers have taken for granted.
