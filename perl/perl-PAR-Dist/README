perl-PAR-Dist (Create and manipulate PAR distributions)

This module creates and manipulates PAR distributions.
They are architecture-specific PAR files, containing everything under blib/ of CPAN distributions after their make or
Build stage, a META.yml describing metadata of the original CPAN distribution, and a MANIFEST detailing all files within it.
Digitally signed PAR distributions will also contain a SIGNATURE file.
