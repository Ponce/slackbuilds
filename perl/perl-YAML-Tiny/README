perl-YAML-Tiny (Read/Write YAML files with a little code as possible).

The YAML specification is huge. Really, really huge. It contains all the functionality of XML,
except with flexibility and choice, which makes it easier to read, but with a formal specification that is more complex than XML.

The original pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4 megabytes of memory to load.
Just like with Windows .ini files (3 meg to load) and CSS (3.5 meg to load) the situation
is just asking for a YAML::Tiny module, an incomplete but correct and usable subset of the functionality, in as little code as possible.

Like the other ::Tiny modules, YAML::Tiny has no non-core dependencies, does not require a compiler to install,
is back-compatible to Perl v5.8.1, and can be inlined into other modules if needed.

In exchange for this adding this extreme flexibility, it provides support for only a limited subset of YAML.
But the subset supported contains most of the features for the more common uses of YAML.
