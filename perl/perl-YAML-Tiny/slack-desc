# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-YAML-Tiny:
perl-YAML-Tiny: The YAML specification is huge. Really, really huge. It contains all
perl-YAML-Tiny: the functionality of XML, except with flexibility and choice, which 
perl-YAML-Tiny: makes it easier to read, but with a formal specification that is more
perl-YAML-Tiny: complex than XML.
