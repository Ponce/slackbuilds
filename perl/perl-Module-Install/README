perl-Module-Install (Standalone, extensible Perl module installer).

Module::Install is a package for writing installers for CPAN (or CPAN-like) distributions that are clean,
simple, minimalist, act in a strictly correct manner with ExtUtils::MakeMaker, and will run on any Perl installation version 5.005 or newer.

The intent is to make it as easy as possible for CPAN authors (and especially for first-time CPAN authors)
to have installers that follow all the best practices for distribution installation, but involve as much
DWIM (Do What I Mean) as possible when writing them.
