IO::All combines all of the best Perl IO modules into a single nifty object 
oriented interface to greatly simplify your everyday Perl IO idioms. It exports 
a single function called io, which returns a new IO::All object. And that 
object can do it all!

The IO::All object is a proxy for IO::File, IO::Dir, IO::Socket, Tie::File, 
File::Spec, File::Path, File::MimeInfo and File::ReadBackwards; as well as all 
the DBM and MLDBM modules. You can use most of the methods found in these 
classes and in IO::Handle (which they inherit from). IO::All adds dozens of 
other helpful idiomatic methods including file stat and manipulation functions.

IO::All is pluggable, and modules like IO::All::LWP and IO::All::Mailto add 
even more functionality. Optionally, every IO::All object can be tied to 
itself. This means that you can use most perl IO builtins on it: readline, 
<>, getc, print, printf, syswrite, sysread, close.

The distinguishing magic of IO::All is that it will automatically open (and 
close) files, directories, sockets and other IO things for you. You never need 
to specify the mode (<, >>, etc), since it is determined by the usage context.
