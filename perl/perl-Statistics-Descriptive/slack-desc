# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-Statistics-Descriptive: perl-Statistics-Descriptive (descriptive statistics functions)
perl-Statistics-Descriptive:
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: Statistics::Descriptive provides basic functions used in descriptive
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: statistics. It has an object oriented design and supports two
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: different types of data storage and calculation objects: sparse and
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: full. With the sparse method, none of the data is stored and only a
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: few statistical measures are available. Using the full method, the
perl-Statistics-Descriptive: entire data set is retained and additional functions are available.
