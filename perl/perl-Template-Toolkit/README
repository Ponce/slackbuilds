The Template Toolkit is a collection of Perl modules which implement a
fast, flexible, powerful and extensible template processing system.

It is "input-agnostic" and can be used equally well for processing any
kind of text documents: HTML, XML, CSS, Javascript, Perl code, plain text,
and so on.

This needs perl-AppConfig.
