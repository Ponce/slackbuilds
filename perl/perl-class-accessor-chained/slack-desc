# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perl-class-accessor-chained: perl-class-accessor-chained (make chained accessors)
perl-class-accessor-chained:
perl-class-accessor-chained: A chained accessor is one that always returns the object when called
perl-class-accessor-chained: with parameters (to set), and the value of the field when called
perl-class-accessor-chained: with no arguments.
perl-class-accessor-chained: This module subclasses Class::Accessor in order to provide the same
perl-class-accessor-chained: mk_accessors interface.
