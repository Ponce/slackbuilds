perl-String-PerlIdentifier (Generate a random name for Perl variable)

String::PerlIdentifier - Generate a random name for a Perl variable.

This module automatically exports a single subroutine, make_varname(),
which returns a string composed of random characters that qualifies as
the name for a Perl variable.
The characters are limited to upper- and lower-case letters in the English alphabet,
the numerals from 0 through 9 and the underscore character.
The first character may not be a numeral.
