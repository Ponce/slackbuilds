File::HomeDir is a module for locating the directories that are
"owned" by a user (typicaly your user) and to solve the various
issues that arise trying to find them consistently across a wide
variety of platforms.

The end result is a single API that can find your resources on any
platform, making it relatively trivial to create Perl software that
works elegantly and correctly no matter where you run it.

This requires perl-File-Which.
