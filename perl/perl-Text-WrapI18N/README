perl-Text-WrapI18N (perl line-wrapping module)

Text::WrapI18N is a line wrapping module with support for multibyte,
fullwidth, and combining characters and languages without whitespace
between words.

This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. It is needed to
support multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR,
GB2312, and Big5.

The text is to be given in locale encoding, not always in UTF-8.
(Of course locale encoding is UTF-8 in UTF-8 locales.)

This perl module is an optional dependency of Po4a.
