perl-WrapI18N (perl module)

Text::WrapI18N - Line wrapping module with support for multibyte, fullwidth,
and combining characters and languages without whitespaces between words.

This module intends to be a better Text::Wrap module. It is needed to support
multibyte character encodings such as UTF-8, EUC-JP, EUC-KR, GB2312, and Big5.

The text is to be given in locale encoding, not always in UTF-8.
(Of course locale encoding is UTF-8 in UTF-8 locales.)

This perl module is an optional dependency of Po4a.
