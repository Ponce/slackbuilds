NetPacket - modules to assemble/disassemble network packets at the protocol
level.

NetPacket provides a base class for a cluster of modules related to decoding
and encoding of network protocols. Each NetPacket descendent module knows how
to encode and decode packets for the network protocol it implements. Consult
the documentation for the module in question for protocol-specific
implementation.
Note that there is no inheritance in the NetPacket:: cluster of modules other
than each protocol module being a NetPacket. This was seen to be too
restrictive as imposing inheritance relationships (for example between the IP,
UDP and TCP protocols) would make things like tunneling or other unusual
situations difficult.

This is not the same module as perl-Net-Packet!
