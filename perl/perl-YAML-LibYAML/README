Kirill Siminov's libyaml is arguably the best YAML implementation. The C 
library is written precisely to the YAML 1.1 specification. It was originally 
bound to Python and was later bound to Ruby.

This module is a Perl XS binding to libyaml which offers Perl the best YAML 
support to date.

This module exports the functions Dump, Load, DumpFile and LoadFile. These 
functions are intended to work exactly like YAML.pm's corresponding functions.
