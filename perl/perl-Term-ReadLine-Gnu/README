perl-Term-ReadLine-Gnu (line-editing and history capabilities)

Term::ReadLine::Gnu provides functions for use by interactive Perl
programs that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed
in. The module includes additional functions to maintain a list of
previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those
lines.
