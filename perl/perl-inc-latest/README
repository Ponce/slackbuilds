perl-inc-latest (use modules bundled in inc/ if they are newer than installed ones)

WARNING -- THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL MODULE.
It was originally bundled (as an experiment) with Module::Build and has been split out for more general use.

The inc::latest module helps bootstrap configure-time dependencies for CPAN distributions.
These dependencies get bundled into the inc directory within a distribution and are used by Makefile.PL or Build.PL.
