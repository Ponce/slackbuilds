File::ShareDir::Install allows you to install read-only data files from a 
distribution. It is a companion module to File::ShareDir, which allows 
you to locate these files after installation.

It is a port of Module::Install::Share to ExtUtils::MakeMaker with the 
improvement of only installing the files you want; .svn, .git and other 
source-control junk will be ignored.

Please note that this module installs read-only data files; empty directories 
will be ignored.
