perl-HTML-Formatter

HTML::Formatter is a base class for classes that take HTML and format
it to some output format. When you take an object of such a base class
and call $formatter-format( $tree )> with an HTML::TreeBuilder (or
HTML::Element) object, they return the appropriately formatted string
for the input HTML.

HTML formatters are able to format a HTML syntax tree into various
printable formats. Different formatters produce output for different
output media. Common for all formatters are that they will return the
formatted output when the format() method is called. The format()
method takes a HTML::Element object (usually the HTML::TreeBuilder root
object) as parameter.
