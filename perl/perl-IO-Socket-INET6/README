IO::Socket::INET6 - Object interface for AF_INET|AF_INET6 domain sockets

IO::Socket::INET6 provides an object interface to creating and using sockets
in either AF_INET or AF_INET6 domains. It is built upon the IO::Socket
interface and inherits all the methods defined by IO::Socket.

This requires perl-Socket6.
