perl-Digest-SHA - Perl extension for SHA-1/224/256/384/512

Digest::SHA is a complete implementation of the NIST Secure
Hash Standard. It gives Perl programmers a convenient way
to calculate SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256 message digests.
The module can handle all types of input, including
partial-byte data.
