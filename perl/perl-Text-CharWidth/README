perl-Text-CharWidth (perl module)

This perl module, Text::CharWidth, gets the number of columns occupied
by a string on a terminal. This is not always equal to the number
of characters, depending on the encoding in use. This is similar to
wcwidth(3) and wcswidth(3) in C.

This perl module is needed by Text::WrapI18N.
