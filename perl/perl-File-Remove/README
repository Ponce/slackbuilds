perl-File-Remove (Remove files and directories).

File::Remove::remove removes files and directories. It acts like /bin/rm, for the most part.
Although unlink can be given a list of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that.
It also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.

File::Remove::trash accepts the same arguments as remove, with the addition of an optional, infrequently used "other platforms" hashref.
