Inline::C is a module that allows you to write Perl subroutines in C. Since 
version 0.30 the Inline module supports multiple programming languages and 
each language has its own support module. This document describes how to use 
Inline with the C programming language. It also goes a bit into Perl C 
internals.

If you want to start working with programming examples right away, check out 
Inline::C::Cookbook. For more information on Inline in general, see Inline.

USAGE

You never actually use Inline::C directly. It is just a support module for 
using Inline.pm with C.
