This module implements an HTTP proxy, using an HTTP::Daemon to accept
client connections, and a LWP::UserAgent to ask for the requested
pages. The most interesting feature of this proxy object is its ability
to filter the HTTP requests and responses through user-defined filters.

This needs libwww-perl.
