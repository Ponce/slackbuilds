This package ships mainly perl module MIME::Charset

MIME::Charset provides informations about character sets used for MIME
messages on Internet.

Documentation : "man MIME::Charset"

Documentation in Japanese: "man POD2::JA::MIME::Charset"

During excution, users are possibly asked if they want auto-installation
of following optional dependencies (perl modules):
  Encode::EUCJPASCII [Extended mappings by Japanese codepages]
  Encode::JISX0213 [Additional mappings for JIS X 0213]
  Encode::HanExtra [Additional mappings for Chinese standards]
Default answer [n] is safe, but these modules can be installed before
perl-MIME-Charset as they are available @ slackbuilds.org, as respectively:
  perl-Encode-EUCJPASCII
  perl-Encode-JISX0213
  perl-Encode-HanExtra

This perl package is a dependency of perl-Unicode-LineBreak.
