perl-IO-Tty (Pseudo TTY object class)

IO::Tty - Perl extension that provides an interface to allow the 
creation of a pseudo tty.

IO::Tty is used internally by IO::Pty to create a pseudo-tty. Do not
use it directly except to import constants, use IO::Pty.

IO::Pty inherits from IO::Handle and so provides all the methods
defined by the IO::Handle package.
