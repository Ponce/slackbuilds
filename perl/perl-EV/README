perl-EV is a perl interface to libev, a high performance full-featured
event loop.

This module is very fast and scalable. It is actually so fast that you
can use it through the AnyEvent module, stay portable to other event
loops (if you don't rely on any watcher types not available through it)
and still be faster than with any other event loop currently supported
in Perl.

Note that this bundles its own version of libev, so it does not depend
on the Slackware version of libev being present.
