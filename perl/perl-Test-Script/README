The intent of Test-Script module is to provide a series of basic
tests for 80% of the testing you will need to do for scripts in the
script (or bin as is also commonly used) paths of your Perl
distribution.  Further, it aims to provide this functionality with
perfect platform-compatibility, and in a way that is as unobtrusive
as possible.

This requires perl-IPC-Run3 and perl-Probe-Perl.
