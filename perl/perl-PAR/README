perl-PAR (Perl Archive Toolkit).

This module lets you use special zip files, called Perl Archives, as libraries from which Perl modules can be loaded.

It supports loading XS modules by overriding DynaLoader bootstrapping methods; it writes shared object file to a temporary file at the time it is needed.
