Qtile is simple, small, and extensible. It's easy to write your own
layouts, widgets, and built-in commands. Qtile is written and configured
entirely in Python, which means you can leverage the full power and
flexibility of the language to make it fit your needs.

You will need to build cairocffi with its optional python3-xcffib
dependency.

python-dbus-next is an optional dependency for qtile.
It sends notifications through dbus - please additionally install a
notification daemon such as dunst for displaying notifications on qtile.

pywlroots (another optional dependency) provides experimental Wayland
support.
