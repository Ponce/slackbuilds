Avant Window Navigator (Awn)

Avant Window Navigator is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of
the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party
applets.

In order to handle transparencies that this application makes use
of, you MUST use a composite desktop manager and, of course, enable
compositing.  Both KDE and XFCE from Slackware distro are composite
capable.

NOTE: The prefences applet crashes on startup, this is a known issue.
