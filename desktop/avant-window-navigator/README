Avant Window Navigator (Awn)

Avant Window Navigator is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of
the screen. It has support for launchers, task lists, and third party
applets.

This requires libgtop, libdesktop-agnostic, GConf, ORBit2, pyxdg, and bzr.

In order to handle transparencies that this application makes use of, you
MUST use a composite desktop manager and, of course, enable compositing.
Both KDE and XFCE from Slackware distro are composite capable.
