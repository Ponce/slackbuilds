wmweather+ will download the National Weather Serivce METAR bulletins;  AVN, ETA, and MRF forecasts; and 
any weather map for display in a WindowMaker dockapp. Think wmweather with a smaller font, forecasts, a 
weather map, and a sky condition display.

Note: This requires a configuration setup in a home folder called ".wmweather+". See "example.conf"
under /usr/doc and read the manpage on how to set it up.
