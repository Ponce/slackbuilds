wmweather+ will download the National Weather Serivce METAR bulletins;  AVN, ETA, and MRF forecasts;
and any weather map for display in a WindowMaker dockapp. Think wmweather with a smaller font,
forecasts, a weather map, and a sky condition display.

Note: This requires a configuration setup in a home folder called ".wmweather+". See "example.conf"
under /usr/doc and read the manpage on how to set it up.
