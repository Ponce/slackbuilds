River is a dynamic tiling Wayland compositor with flexible runtime
configuration based on wlroots.
River can either be run nested in an X11/Wayland session or 
directly from a tty using KMS/DRM. Simply run the river command.

On startup river will run an executable file at
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/river/init if such an executable exists. 
If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, ~/.config/river/init will 
be used instead.
Usually this executable is a shell script invoking riverctl(1) 
to create mappings, start programs such as a layout generator
or status bar, and perform other configuration.
For complete documentation see the river(1), riverctl(1), and 
rivertile(1) man pages
here is an example of init to river
