doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest
both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime
compared to other feature-rich alternatives.

It brings the ability of compiled languages such as D / Rust / Nim
to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast,
transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.
