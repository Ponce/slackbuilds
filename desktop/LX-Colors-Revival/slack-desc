# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

LX-Colors-Revival: LX-Colors-Revival (GTK2/GTK3/Openbox themes)
LX-Colors-Revival:
LX-Colors-Revival: This is an update to the LX-Colors theme series and now compatible
LX-Colors-Revival: with GTK 3.20. This is an attempt to keep the legendary Shiki-Colors
LX-Colors-Revival: theme series alive, in four variations, such as Light, Mixed (light,
LX-Colors-Revival: but with dark menus), NeoShiki (the LXDE/Openbox successor to
LX-Colors-Revival: Shiki-Colors), and Pitchdark (all-dark variations).
