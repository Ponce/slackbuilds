LX-Colors-Revival (GTK2/GTK3/Openbox themes)

This is an update to the LX-Colors theme series and now compatible
with GTK 3.20. This is an attempt to keep the legendary Shiki-Colors
theme series alive, in four variations, such as Light, Mixed (light,
but with dark menus), NeoShiki (the LXDE/Openbox successor to
Shiki-Colors), and Pitchdark (all-dark variations).

New features in this edition includes:

 * Two new color schemes: Carbonite (dark gray) and Tribute
(light gray, kinda gold-ish)
 * An update to the GNOME-Colors icon theme series that now includes
the new aforementioned colors, created by Kylie McClain of Somasis.com.
Please give her some love and thank her for her hard work.
 * In addition the classic Arc-Colors wallpapers, I've also resized
them for smartphones and have called the smartphone versions of those
wallpapers just simply "Mobile-Colors"

* This package is compatible with "old" LX-Colors-themes.
