Zenity is a tool that allows you to display GTK dialog boxes from
the command line and through shell scripts. It is designed to be
similar to the classic `dialog` program, but with a GUI interface.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:

* webkit2gtk-6.0 (ie, webkitgtk for gtk4; NOT yet part of sbo-ponce as
  of 2024-07-28)

  To enable: pass `WEBKITGTK=true` as an option to the slackbuild.
  If this is not specified, it will default to `false`.
