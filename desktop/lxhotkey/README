lxhotkey is a plugin-based shortcuts editor for window managers.

openbox is an optional dependency (and ATM the only window
manager supported).

at the moment the application can be used from the command line
and from gtk+2 and gtk+3 GUIs: the developer, Andrej N. Gritsenko,
invites interested users to write theirselves other GUI plugins
(Qt, etc.) they may need.

by default the gtk+2 plugin is built: to build the gtk+3 one
pass the script the parameter GTK=3
