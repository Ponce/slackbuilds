Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.
It is based on the very strong Xapian backend, for which it provides an
easy to use, feature-rich, easy administration, QT graphical interface. 
Recoll is able to include several separate folders in its search.

To enable splitting of CamelCase words take a look in the SlackBuild
file. This feature is disabled by default.

antiword, unrtf, untex, lxml, mutagen and exiftool are runtime deps.
You can build and run recoll without it, but recoll will keep nagging
you about the missing helper tools. Without those tools recoll will be
not usable for most people anyway, and these tools are quite small.
But if you want to go without any of them you can do so at the time of
writing. Your mileage may vary of course in the future.
