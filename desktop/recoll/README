Recoll is a personal full text search tool for Unix/Linux.
It is based on the very strong Xapian backend, for which it provides an 
easy to use, feature-rich, easy administration, QT graphical interface. 
Recoll is able to include several separate folders in its search.

To enable splitting of CamelCase words take a look in the SlackBuild
file. This feature is disabled by default.

This requires xapian-core.

Optional dependencies are antiword, unrtf, and exiftool.
