odccm is a legacy-free dccm-implementation for Windows Mobile 5 
(and newer) devices.

odccm now supports pre Windows Mobile 5 devices by passing
"--enable-legacy-support" to configure.  It does not replace the 
functionality of synce-serial, which must still be properly 
installed and configured.

This requires libsynce and gnet.
