cairo-dock is a unified interface to your desktop : it provides a dock, 
a taskbar, and many applets that can be placed either inside the dock 
or on your desktop, at your convenience!

It uses Cairo/OpenGL to render nice graphics with hardware acceleration,
which makes it very smooth and low on CPU. It's highly customisable and 
comes with a lot of ready-to-use themes.

This requires gtkglext.
