buttonmaker (simple launcher dockapp for windowmaker)

Like other button dockapps, itâ€™s a button that runs a command.
It has support for png, jpeg, xpm, tiff, etc. thanks to Imlib2.
You can use an image of your choice to display on the button.

There is no man page or README, but try "buttonmaker --help".
