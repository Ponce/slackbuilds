xpenguins (animated penguins for your desktop)

Ever wanted cute little penguins walking along the tops of your windows?
Ever wanted to send an army of cute little penguins to invade the screen
of someone else on your network? Probably not, but why not try this
program out anyway - it's free (licensed under the GNU GPL).

If you'd rather have Bart Simpson, Sonic the Hedgehog, or something
else besides just penguins, install xpenguins-xtrathemes.
