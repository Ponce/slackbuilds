The thunar-thumbnailers project provides additional thumbnailers for
use by the Thunar file manager. Thumbnailers are little utilities that
run in the background to generate previews for certain file types.

After installing this package, each user will need to execute the
following command:

/usr/libexec/thunar-vfs-update-thumbnailers-cache-1

Optional dependencies are dcraw (for raw image support) and
ffmpegthumbnailer (for video file support).  If you wish to enable
support for either or both of these, you will need to edit the
build script to do so - the required lines are commented out. If
you choose to compile with dcraw (--enable-raw), you'll also need
raw-thumbnailer.
