pytyle (extensible tiling manager).

An extensible tiling manager that can fit into any EWMH compatible 
window manager. Uses Python and the Python X Library.

PyTyle is meant to run in the background, so run it like so:

    pytyle &
    
You may want to add the above command to your ~/.xinitrc or
another startup script like ~/.config/openbox/autostart.

If you're having trouble running it on start up, try this in
your ~/.xinitrc:

    (sleep 5 && pytyle) &
    
It will give the window manager time to startup before PyTyle starts
asking it for information. Increase/decrease the sleep timeout
appropriately.

After PyTyle has been executed for the first time, it will create a
configuration file in your XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pytyle/ directory (usually
~/.config/pytyle) called pytylerc. The comments in the configuration
file will explain everything.

It has been tested relatively well on OpenBox and partially on Fluxbox.
It should, in theory, work with any window manager complying with the 
EWMH standards.
