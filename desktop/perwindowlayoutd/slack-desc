# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

perwindowlayoutd: perwindowlayoutd (Keeps per window keyboard layout under X11)
perwindowlayoutd:
perwindowlayoutd: Sometimes you want to setup switching keyboard layouts using
perwindowlayoutd: X server - because there is no DE plugin, or it's broken, or
perwindowlayoutd: lacks needed functionality.  You can easily configure X
perwindowlayoutd: server to switch keyboard layouts, but I could not find way
perwindowlayoutd: of keeping layout for each window separately using only X
perwindowlayoutd: server.  Hence this package.
