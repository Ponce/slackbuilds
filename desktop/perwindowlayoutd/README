Sometimes you want to setup switching keyboard layouts using X server - because
there is no DE plugin, or it's broken, or lacks needed functionality.  You can
easily configure X server to switch keyboard layouts, but I could not find way
of keeping layout for each window separately using only X server.  Hence this
package.
