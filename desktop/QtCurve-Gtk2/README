This is a set of widget styles for Gtk2 based apps.

The fonts and colours for the GTK themes will be read in from your Qt 
settings so any KDE font/colour changes will also affect your GTK apps.

If you want Gtk2 apps to use the theme system wide, create a symbolic
link to the new theme like this:
  ln -s /usr/share/themes/QtCurve/gtk-2.0/gtkrc /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc

Note that in Slackware 13.1, KDE and GTK assume different things.  The GTK+2
package is compiled to use /etc/gtk-2.0/*-slackware-linux/gtkrc, while KDE
is hardcoded to look in /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc.  Consequently, you will probably
want to put your preferred gtkrc in the GTK path, and then put a symlink to
it at /etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc for KDE to use (or vice versa - either will work).

Alternatively, gtk-chtheme works fine on a per user basis.
