# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

wmii:
wmii: wmii is a dynamic window manager for X11. It supports classic and
wmii: dynamic window management with extended keyboard, mouse, and
wmii: filesystem based remote control. It replaces the workspace paradigm
wmii: with a new tagging approach. Its minimalist philosophy attempts to
wmii: not exceed 10.000 lines of code (including all shipped utilities and
wmii: libraries), to enforce simplicity and clarity.
