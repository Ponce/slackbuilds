i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch.

i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time,
didn't provide some features we wanted (multi-monitor done right,
for example), had some bugs, didn't progress since quite some time and
wasn't easy to hack at all (source code comments/documentation completely
lacking). Still, we think the wmii developers and contributors did a
great job. Thank you for inspiring us to create i3.

Please be aware that i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and
developers.

This requires libev, yajl, and dmenu.

i3status and dzen2 are optional, but useful to provide a system status
bar.
