# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

i3: i3 (an improved dynamic tiling window manager)
i3:
i3: i3 is a tiling window manager, completely written from scratch.
i3:
i3: i3 was created because wmii, our favorite window manager at the time,
i3: didn't provide some features we wanted (multi-monitor done right,
i3: for example), had some bugs, didn't progress since quite some time
i3: and wasn't easy to hack at all (source code comments/documentation
i3: completely lacking). Still, we think the wmii developers and
i3: contributors did a great job.
