Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, as well
as a useful environment in and of itself.

Out of the box, Weston provides a very basic desktop, or a full-featured
environment for non-desktop uses such as automotive, embedded,
in-flight, industrial, kiosks, set-top boxes and TVs. It also provides a
library allowing other projects to build their own full-featured
environments on top of Weston's core.

A small suite of example or demo clients are also provided: though they
can be useful in themselves, their main purpose is to be an example or
test case for others building compositors or clients.

Optional Dependencies:

At the present time, the only optional dependency for this SlackBuild is
colord, which is disabled by default. That is because colord pulls in
many dependencies.

If you would like to enable colord functionality in this SlackBuild, set
the USE_COLORD variable to "true" before running the SlackBuild.

NOTE:

Weston 10.x is the last version of Weston to be supported on Slackware
15.0, as greater versions require a version of wayland-protocols which
is more recent than provided by Slackware 15.0.
