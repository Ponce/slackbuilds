wmxss (XScreenSaver DockApp)

A simple dockapp frontend for XScreenSaver that can also display XSS
screensavers. Execute like so:

wmxss -e xflame

"xflame" in the example can be replaced by any of the screensavers in
/usr/libexec/xscreensaver, or any screensaver on the filesystem if an
absolute path is given.
