trayer-srg (GTK2-based systray for UNIX desktop)

trayer is a small program designed to provide systray functionality
present in GNOME/KDE desktop environments for window managers which
do not support that function. It's similar to other applications
such as 'peksystray' and 'docker'. 

trayer-srg was forked from trayer in 2010 to add some fancy features 
and clean up the code.
