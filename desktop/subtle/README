subtle (ruby based tiling WM)

A grid-based manual tiling window manager with a strong focus on easy
but customizable look and feel Subtle has a rather uncommon approach of
tiling: Per default there is no typical layout enforcement, windows are
placed on a position (gravity) in a custom grid. The user can change the
gravity of each window either directly per grabs or with rules defined
by tags in the config.
