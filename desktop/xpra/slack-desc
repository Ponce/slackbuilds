# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xpra: Xpra is known as "screen for X". Its seamless mode allows you to
xpra: run X11 programs, usually on a remote host, direct their display
xpra: to your local machine, and then to disconnect from these programs
xpra: and reconnect from the same or another machine(s), without losing
xpra: any state. This effectively gives you remote access to individual
xpra: graphical applications. It can also be used to access existing
xpra: desktop sessions and start remote desktop sessions.
