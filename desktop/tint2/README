tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar intentionally made for openbox3, but
should also work with other window managers.  It's based off ttm code.

The goal is to keep a clean and unintrusive look with lightweight code
and compliance with freedesktop specifications.

On the first run, /etc/xdg/tint2/tint2rc is copied to
~/.config/tint2/tint2rc and used as the default configuration.
