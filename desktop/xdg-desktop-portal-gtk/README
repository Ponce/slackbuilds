xdg-desktop-portal-gtk

A backend implementation for xdg-desktop-portal that is using
GTK+ and various pieces of GNOME infrastructure, such as the
org.gnome.Shell.Screenshot or org.gnome.SessionManager D-Bus
interfaces.

To enable the wallpaper portal (the dependency gnome-desktop
is additionally required), pass WALLPAPER=yes to the SlackBuild.
