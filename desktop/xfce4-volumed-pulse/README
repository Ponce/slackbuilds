This daemon is responsible of making the volume up/down and mute keys of the keyboard
work automatically, and uses Pulseaudio for chosing which card/sink/track to act on.
It also provides volume change / mute toggle notifications if the notification server
used supports x-canonical-icon-only and x-canonical-synchronous notifications.

This is a fork of the original xfce4-volumed to drop Gstreamer support and use
Pulseaudio instead.
