mimi is an improved verision of xdg-open. The original xdg-open works horribly without DE environment.

Note:

This WILL overwrite xdg-open. If you desire to go back to the original xdg-open script, be sure to
reinstall xdg-utils from Slackware's repo.

You specifically define what applications should be opened by which mime type. Simple make a text file
at "~/.config/mimi/mime.conf" and edit it to your liking. If you don't feel like doing, this mimi will
automatically find the best suited desktop file for the file. More info on the Github page.
