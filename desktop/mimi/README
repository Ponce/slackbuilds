mimi is an improved verision of xdg-open. The original xdg-open works horribly
without DE environment.

Note:

This WILL overwrite xdg-open. If you desire to go back to the original
xdg-open script, be sure to reinstall xdg-utils from Slackware's repo.

You specifically define what applications should be opened by which mime type.
Simply make a text file at "~/.config/mimi/mime.conf" and edit it to your
liking. If you don't feel like doing this, mimi will automatically find the
best suited desktop file for the file. More info on the Github page.
