# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

caffeine-ng:
caffeine-ng: Caffeine is a little daemon that sits in your systray, and prevents
caffeine-ng: the screensaver from showing up, or the system from going to sleep.
caffeine-ng: It does so when an application is fullscreened (eg: youtube), or when
caffeine-ng: you click on the systray icon (which you can do, when, eg: reading).
