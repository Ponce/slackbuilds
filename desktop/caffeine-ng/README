Caffeine is a little daemon that sits in your systray, and prevents
the screensaver from showing up, or the system from going to sleep. It
does so when an application is fullscreened (eg: youtube), or when
you click on the systray icon (which you can do, when, eg: reading).

This is a fork of Caffeine 2.4, since later versions dropped support
for the systray icon in favour of automatic detection of fullscreen
apps only.

The dependencies require python3 support where available and python3
should be installed before any of the other dependencies.

setuptools-scm is only required as a build dependency and can be
skipped if you would rather have it automatically grabbed from
pypi.python.org during the build process.
