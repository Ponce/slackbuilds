I'll be honest with you. The truth is: wmblob is a totally useless program. But unlike other
totally useless programs, it looks good and shows funny moving `blobs'. I'm sure you'll like it.
It's a nice dockapp for WindowMaker, but it's probably going to run just as well with any other
 window manager.
