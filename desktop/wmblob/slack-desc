# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wmblob: wmblob (Fancy Moving Blobs DockApp)

wmblob: I'll be honest with you. The truth is: wmblob is a totally useless
wmblob: program. But unlike other totally useless programs, it looks good and
wmblob: shows funny moving `blobs'. I'm sure you'll like it. It's a nice
wmblob: dockapp for WindowMaker, but it's probably going to run just as well
wmblob: with any other window manager.
