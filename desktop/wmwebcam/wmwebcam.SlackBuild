# 20210909 bkw: I still don't have (or want) a webcam. All I can say
# about wmwebcam is that it compiles, creates a valid package, and
# when I run it, "Can't open device /dev/video0" (as expected). Do
# you use this? Please take it!

# 20160821 bkw:
# - take over maintenance
# - BUILD=2
# - i486 => i586
# - fix a (probably harmless) compiler warning
# - actually use SLKCFLAGS
# - install binary stripped
# - TODO: find a new maintainer, as I don't own a webcam!
