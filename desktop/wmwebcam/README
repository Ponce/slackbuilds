wmwebcam is a dockapp that grabs an image from your webcam every second and displays the captured
image. Original written years ago, it was updated by eukara to work with the newer V4L2. Credits go to
him for the fix.

You can customize the device location, webcam delay, and size. However, this must be done in the source
before compile. To make this easier a patch is included, just open it in your favorite editor, read the
comments, and edit the variables to your liking (make sure it's the lines with the "+" in front).

There is also a default perl script that can upload the captured images to a FTP, this is also
configurable in the patch.
