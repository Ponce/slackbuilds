Synce-hal is a connection framework and dccm-implementation 
for Windows Mobile devices that integrates with HAL.

For usb connections, most devices should be autodetected, if yours is not, 
please inform the synce project and we'll fix it !  Both WM5/6 and older 
style devices are fully supported. If you want to connect WM5/6 over rndis 
(advanced network functionality), the rndis_host module in the kernel is 
reasonable from 2.6.24 or 2.6.26, depending on the distribution. Otherwise 
you will need to install the usb-rndis-lite modules. Rndis connections will 
attempt to use dhcp, only falling back to a static configuration if that is 
unsuccessful.

This requires libsynce, odccm, and librapi2.
