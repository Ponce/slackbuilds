wmfs (Window Manager From Scratch) is a lightweight and highly
configurable tiling window manager for X.  It can be configured
with a configuration file, supports Xft (Freetype) fonts, and
is compliant with the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) spec,
Xinerama, and Xrandr.  wmfs can be driven with Vi based commands
(Viwmfs).  wmfs also comes with a built-in systray.

This requires imlib2.
