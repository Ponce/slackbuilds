awesome-appmenu is a tool to create a menu of installed applications
for the awesome window manager. It searches for and parses .desktop
files to create a lua script containing the menu, which can then be
used in your awesome WM configuration script. It supports icons, and
the paths to search for launchers and icons, as well as the categories
used for grouping applications, are fully configurable.
