quickaccess (KDE plasmoid)

This is a small applet designed for the panel to have quick access to the most 
used folders.

This is a maintenance fork for the QuickAccess plasmoid.

After installing, if you are currently running KDE, you need to run 
"kbuildsycoca4" as your normal user account.

If the plasmoid does not show up in the "Add Applets" dialog, then try restarting 
plasma (again as the KDE user): "kquitapp plasma && plasma"
