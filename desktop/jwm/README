JWM (Joe's Window Manager) is a lightweight stacking window manager
for the X Window System written by Joe Wingbermuehle. JWM is written
in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum.
It provides an interface similar to Windows 98 with a modern-looking
appearance and it can support some GNOME, Motif and Extended Window
Manager Hints.
