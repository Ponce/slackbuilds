lxlauncher (Application launcher for netbooks)

LXLauncher is an open source clone of Asus launcher for EeePC.
It outperformes the original launcher developed by Xandros.  Background
images used by Asus launcher are non-free and are hence not included in
this package.  If you add these images yourself they will be used.

This requires lxmenu-data.
