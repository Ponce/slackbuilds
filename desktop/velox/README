velox (velox is a simple window manager based on swc)

velox is a simple window manager based on swc. It is inspired by dwm   
and xmonad.

velox uses tag-based window management similar to dwm. This allows you
to construct your workspace by selecting a set of tags to work with.
However, in contrast with dwm, windows do not have any screen 
associated with them; they are shown on whichever screen has their tag
selected, allowing you to easily move windows between screens by 
selecting their tag on a different screen. This is similar to the 
multi-monitor workspace switching in xmonad.

Copy /usr/doc/velox-0.0.3/velox.conf.sample to your $HOME/.velox.conf.

Optional dependencie: dmenu.
