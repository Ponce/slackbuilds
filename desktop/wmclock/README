wmclock is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable
tile in the same style as the clock from the NEXTSTEP(tm) operating
system. wmclock is specially designed for the Window Maker window
manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and features multiple language support,
twenty-four-hour and twelve-hour (am/pm) time display, and, optionally,
can run a user-specified program on a mouse click.

wmclock can display the month and weekday abbreviations in any of these
languages:

breton croatian czech danish dutch english french french2 german
hungarian indonesian italian norwegian polish portuguese russian
slovene spanish swedish ukrainian

To set the default language, set LANGUAGE to one of the above in the
environment before running wmclock.SlackBuild, e.g.

$ LANGUAGE=french ./wmclock.SlackBuild

This only sets the default; the other languages can still be used via
the -monthxpm and -weekdayxpm command line options (see the wmclock man
page for details).
