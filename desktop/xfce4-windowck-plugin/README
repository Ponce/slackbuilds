xfce4-windowck-plugin is a set of two plugins
which allows to put the maximized window title
and window buttons on the xfce4-panel.

After upgrading to version 0.4.0 you may need to make some changes to the plugin settings to retain previous look and feel.

Note- python3 is a build time dependency.
