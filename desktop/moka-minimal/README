moka-minimal (gnome icon theme).

Grayscale versions of Moka & Faba icons (already in SlackBuilds).

Moka inherits Faba, so index.theme modified to inherit Faba-Minimal, which inherits gnome, in that order.

This is not dependent of packages 'faba-icon-theme' or 'moka-icon-theme'.

NOTE: p7zip is used only to extract the source.
