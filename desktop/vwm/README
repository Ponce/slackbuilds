vwm (console text-based window manager)

Viper Window Manager (VWM) is a lightweight, extensible window manager
for the console. Originally, VWM was designed to be the reference
implementation of libviper. In fact, the two projects were initially
one before public release.

From conception, VWM was designed to be both lightweight and ssh
friendly. Character based line-art compresses very well as do the
escape sequences which handle cursor manipulation. This makes VWM quite
suitable for low-bandwidth, remote connectivity over ssh.

It is also very easy to extend the functionality of VWM. By following
a few simple API rules, anyone can create a "native application"
which will appear on the VWM Main Menu. The mechanism for this is very
similar to Mozilla-style plugins.

See /usr/doc/$VERSION/samples/vwmrc for information on customising VWM.
