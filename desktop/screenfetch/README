Screenfetch is a Bash Screenshot Information Tool. This handy
Bash script can be used to generate one of those nifty terminal
theme information + ASCII distribution logos you see in everyone's
screenshots nowadays. It will auto-detect your distribution and
display an ASCII version of that distribution's logo and some
valuable information to the right.

scrot is an optional dependency. Without it you won't be able to
use -t option (take screenshot).
