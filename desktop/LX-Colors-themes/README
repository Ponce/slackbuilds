LX-Colors-themes (GTK2/GTK3/Openbox themes)

This is a series of GTK2/GTK3/Openbox themes not only in each of the 
official seven Shiki-Colors color schemes, but there are also five 
different styles available as well:

 * Light: Kinda like Elementary (just use Elementary or something similar 
as your Metacity/Unity/Cinnamon/etc. theme)

 * Mixed: Like the light version, except with dark menus.

 * NeoShiki: A GTK2/3 Shiki-Colors remake. For this style as well as the 
two after it, I have also posted a link to the original Shiki-Colors 
themes so that you can download the Metacity themes, which I have 
designed these themes to seamlessly integrate with.

 * Obsidian: Dark, but with a white base and black text for compatibility 
with some websites, plus its also the basis for some of the other color 
variations I have in mind that Ill be creating later.

 * PitchDark: A true dark variation.

In other words, there are 35 themes in all! Moreover, they are available 
either sorted by color scheme or by style. The names will be reversed so 
that they show up in order by your choice of color or style, but all the 
contents are identical.

As an added bonus, there are some other color variations I have in mind 
with these themes, which will be periodically released on here, along 
with matching GNOME-Colors-styled icon themes, so stay tuned!

Optional dependencies: gtk-engines, murrine, gnome-colors.
