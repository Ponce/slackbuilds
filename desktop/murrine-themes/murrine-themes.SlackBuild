# Many thanks to Debian and ROSA Linux for bundling these themes together!
# Note about the version. The script combines the themes in Debian (version
# 0.98.11) with the themes from ROSA Linux (version 2.0), therefore we pack:
# 0.98.11 + 2.0 = 2.98.11. We also include the default Xfwm Murrina theme:
# http://xfce-look.org/content/show.php/Murrine++Xfwm+Theme?content=43083
