peksystray (small system tray)

Peksystray is a small system tray (also called notification tray)
designed for all the light window managers supporting docking. As
more and more applications use a small icon in the system tray to
provide additonal functionalities and information, it becomes useful
for everyone to have access to them. While "heavy" window managers
(Gnome, KDE...) come with a systrem tray embedded in the rest of the
desktop, lighter window managers (WindowMaker, fluxbox...) don't have
this feature. Peksystray is a very simple and light implementation of
a system tray for any window manager supporting docking, conforming to
the System Tray Freedesktop standard.
