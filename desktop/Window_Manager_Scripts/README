Window-Manager-Scripts is a series of window manager agnostic shell scripts. They're intended to be 
lightweight, relying on few deps as possible and include a configuration file for easy customization.

Optional requirements: cURL recompiled with OpenSSL support for SFTP image uploading, xclip to copy
the uploaded image URL to clipboard, and xwinwrap if you want to use video backgrounds.

Note: Copy the ".xyscripts" from the /usr/doc folder, place it in your home folder, and customize
it your liking.
