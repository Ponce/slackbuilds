.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
wmtimer \-[a|c|r] [\-b] [\-color \fI<color>\fP] [\-display \fI<display>\fP] [\-geometry \fI<geom>\fP] \-t \fI<hh:mm:ss>\fP \-e \fI<command>\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBwmtimer\fP is a dockable alarm clock for WindowMaker which can be run in
alarm, countdown timer, or chronograph mode. In alarm or timer mode,
you can either execute a command or sound the system bell when the time
is reached.
.sp
\fBwmtimer\fP can be configured either at startup time via the command
line, or by using the GTK interface by clicking on the main part of the
window (anywhere except the buttons).
.sp
To switch to the Chrono function simply click on the right arrow button to
start the chronograph.
.sp
You can pause the chronogaph by clicking on the center, rectangle button
and resume again by clicking the right arrow button.
.sp
You can reset the timer by clicking on the left arrow button.
.sp
Without any of the \fB\-a\fP, \fB\-c\fP, or \fB\-r\fP options, \fBwmtimer\fP
just shows the current time until it\(aqs clicked on.
.sp
Time entered via the command line must be in the form of hh:mm:ss. You
don\(aqt need to have 2 digits for each number but you must have at least
zeroes as placeholders for hours, minutes and seconds.
