# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

skulpture: skulpture (qt4 style)
skulpture:
skulpture: Skulpture is a GUI style addon for qt4, featuring classical
skulpture: three-dimensional artwork. Flat gradients are used to oppose
skulpture: the current trend of shiny or "glassy" buttons used in other
skulpture: styles. Light and shadow effects are applied to generate the
skulpture: impression of a three-dimensional user interface.
