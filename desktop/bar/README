bar - bar ain't recursive

bar is a lightweight bar entirely based on XCB. Provides full UTF-8 support,
basic formatting, RandR and Xinerama support and EWMH compliance without
wasting your precious memory.

The name of the bar program has been changed to lemonbar. In this release,
I have included symlinks to prevent breakage:
   bar => lemonbar
   bar.1.gz => lemonbar.1.gz
Future releases will likely not contain these symlinks, so I recommend
fixing any scripts using bar to use lemonbar before the next upgrade.
The SlackBuild name will likely change to lemonbar, also.
