# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

wmfire: file or just be set to show a pretty flame. On entering the dock a
wmfire: burning spot replaces the cursor, and after two seconds symbols to
wmfire: represent the current monitor are "burnt" onscreen. The flame colour
