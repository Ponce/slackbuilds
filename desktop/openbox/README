Openbox is a standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible
window manager.  Openbox was written first to comply with standards
and to work properly.  Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone
working environment, or can be used as a drop-in replacement for
the default window manager in the GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

To use Openbox in KDE or GNOME please specify this in the script or
when running the script by setting KXINIT or GXINIT to "YES",
respectively.  For example, to add an option to use Openbox in KDE
you can run:

KXINIT=YES ./openbox.SlackBuild

If you do not make the package with this support and you want to run
Openbox in KDE or GNOME, then you should copy the respective xinitrc
script from /usr/doc/openbox/xinit to /etc/X11/xinit/.  You will
also need to copy openbox-kde-session or openbox-gnome-session to
/usr/bin/.  To be used, all the scripts will need to be executable.

NOTE: This SlackBuild nows has xinit scripts for openbox and
openbox-session.  You *must* select "openbox-session" in order to
use your autostart file.  It is recommended that you run xwmconfig
to correct this if you have used previous versions of this
SlackBuild.  Similarly, select "Openbox-Session" instead of
"Openbox" in KDM/XDM if you want session management and your
autostart file to be used.

If you do not plan on using a session manager with Openbox you can
build a smaller binary by disabling session management support.  To
do this simply configure with '--disable-session-management'.

imlib2 is an optional dependency.
