This contains a collection of over 400 Slackware-dedicated and/or
otherwise related wallpapers.

The images are placed in /usr/share/wallpapers and will be shown in
the KDE wallpaper chooser. Also, xscreensaver will automatically find
them there and use the images for screensavers like "Carousel".

The script creates symlinks for the background choosers of XFCE and
MATE, too. In case you do not want this, check the script.

CREDITS:
I am not the author of these! I just gathered what I already had
around or have found meanwhile.

To track all the authors would be quite troublesome or impossible.
Therefore if someone recognised their work and (rightfully) wants to
be credited, please let me know!

NOTE!
The unarchived size of this is about 300 MB.
