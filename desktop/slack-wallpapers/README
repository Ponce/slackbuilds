This contains a collection of over 200 Slackware-dedicated wallpapers.
The images are placed in /usr/share/wallpapers to make xscreensaver
happy :) 

I am not the author of these! I just gathered what I already had
around or have found meanwhile. Any additions are very welcome!

NOTE: the unarchived size of this is around 100 MB.
