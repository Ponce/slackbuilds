moka-icon-theme (gnome icon theme)

Moka is a stylized Linux desktop icon set, and the titular icon theme of the Moka Project.
They are designed to be clear, simple and consistent.

Moka was created with minimal, flat style, using simple geometry & colours.
Each icon has been pixel-perfectly-designed and for the best experience throughout your desktop.

As one of the most comprehensive icon sets available for the Linux desktop, Moka provides thousands of icons for many applications.

No matter which desktop you are using, Moka has you covered; it's for all of the popular Linux desktop environments.

Moka is only a set of application icons, it relies on its companion icon set "Faba Icon Theme".

From Faba Icon Theme, Moka inherits all the system icons, folders, panel icons, etc. to make a complete experience.
