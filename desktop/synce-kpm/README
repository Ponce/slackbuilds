SynCE-KPM stands for SynCE KDE PDA Manager and aims to be an 
application to manage WM5/WM6 PDA devices from Linux.

This requires pysetuptools, libsynce, and librapi2.  
synce-hal and odccm are optional (device-dependent) dependencies.

Mini HOW-TO
1. Start odccm as root
2. Unlock the phone
3. Run pstatus (librapi2 pkg) to verify the communication is ok.
4. Run sync-engine
5. You should be ready for synce-kpm
