dwm is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled and
floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing
the environment for the application in use and the task performed. It
is the little brother of wmii.

As of 6.1, `st` is the default terminal. This does not require
installing `st`, only symlinking your favorite terminal to:

  /usr/local/bin/st

See README.CONFIG for more information.
