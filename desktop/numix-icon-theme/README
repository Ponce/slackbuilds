numix-icon-theme (official icon theme from the Numix project)

Numix is the official icon theme from the Numix project. It is 
heavily inspired by, and based upon parts of the Elementary, 
Humanity and Gnome icon themes. Designed to be used along side the 
application icon theme Numix Circle.

Numix is designed to look fresh, swishy and modern using white 
symbols on vividly coloured background for applications and 
simplistic devices, toolbars and status icons.
