Hi suckless developers!,

After a long time (dwm 4.5 was released on 2012-01-08) it is time for a new
dmenu release. Thanks goes out to all the people involved at making the software
better in various ways!

Alot of things have changed, make sure to update your config.h and rebase the
wiki patches you maintain on dmenu 4.6.

The older wiki patches (specifically pre-4.5 and legacy) and
functionality that was merged
(xft) will be removed in a while (few weeks time).

Release notes
=============

I tried to reconstruct the notes from the git log and give credit to
the proper authors, there may be some mistakes.

Features:
  - Now uses Xft for font rendering by default with fallback-font
support, this also allows anti-aliased fonts and such.
    The font string matching will be different, check out
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html
    for the font string syntax, huge thanks to Eric Pruitt and the
other people who worked on the dmenu-xft patch (previously on the
wiki).
  - Uses a shared libdraw codebase (also used for dwm right now).
  - Merged wiki patches:
    - monarg: allow to specify monitor number to start on with -m (Martin Kühl).
    - multisel: allow selecting multiple items (ctrl-enter) (Evan Gates).
    - xft: see above.
  - Accepted vi'is exit approach ^[ (Arkaduisz).
  - Add ^G escape keybinding (Karl F).
  - Separate config options to config.h (Alex Sedov).
  - Support keybind C-S-[jm] (Connor Lane Smith).
  - stest: get rid of getopt, use suckless arg.h (Hiltjo).
  - stest: support inverse matching (flag -v) (Martin Kühl).

Notable fixes:
  - Buffer nul termination on tab (Alex Sedov's).
  - Crash (pointer dereference) with ctrl-enter as input (Hiltjo).
  - Ignore prompt if it is empty in addition to NULL (Moritz Wilhelmy).
  - Incorrect ordering of match results (Davide Del Zompo).
  - Input text matching (Quentin Rameau).
  - Paste from clipboard (ctrl+shift+y) (Joshua Lloret).
  - Replace deprecated usleep() with nanosleep() (Quentin Rameau).
  - dmenu_run: Split cache logic to dmenu_path again (Quentin Glidic).
  - multimon: always spawn client on first monitor if specified with
-m 0 (Hiltjo).
  - reset ControlMask for C-j and C-m (Hiltjo).

Build improvements:
  - config.mk: add $FREETYPELIBS and $FREETYPEINC, simpler to override
(ports and *BSDs).
  - config.mk: improve feature test check (k0ga, stateless).
  - config.mk: use -std=c99 by default.

Kind regards,
Hiltjo Posthuma
