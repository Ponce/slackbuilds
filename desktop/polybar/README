Polybar aims to help users build beautiful and highly customizable
status bars for their desktop environment, without the need of having a
black belt in shell scripting.

Optional dependencies for extended module support:
  * jsoncpp required by internal/i3
  * libmpdclient required by internal/mpd
  * siji-font for additional font support

Building the documentation and the man pages requires the optional
dependency Sphinx.
