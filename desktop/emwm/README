EMWM is a fork of the Motif Window Manager with fixes and enhancements.
The idea behind this is to provide compatibility with current xorg
extensions and applications, without changing the way the window manager
looks and behaves. This includes support for multi-monitor setups
trough Xinerama/Xrandr, UFT-8 support with Xft fonts, and overall better
compatibility with software that requires Extended Window Manager Hints.
Additionally a couple of goodies are available in the separate utilities
package: XmToolbox, a toolchest like application launcher, which
reads it's multi-level menu structure from a simple plain-text file
~/.toolboxrc, and XmSm, a simple session manager that provides
session configuration, locking and shutdown/suspend options.
