rss-guard (tiny feed reader)

RSS Guard is useful and (very) tiny RSS 0.92/1.0/2.0 & ATOM 1.0
feed reader. It can keep feeds organized in categories, update
information from them automatically and notice user
if there is new message.

By default it uses qt-4.x but it supports using qt5 too: if you
want to build against it, pass the script the option QT5=yes
