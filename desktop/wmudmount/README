wmudmount (file system mounter, windowmaker dockapp)

A filesystem mounter that uses udisks to handle notification of new
filesystems and mounting of the filesystems as a non-root user. It also
includes a mode to display the mounted filesystems with the least free
space percentage (similar to wmfsm).

This build is for version 2.2, which uses udisks2 and GTK3. If you'd
prefer to build an older version with udisks1 and GTK2, download the
source from here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/wmudmount/files/wmudmount/wmudmount-1.13.tar.gz

Its md5sum is: 988955faca6db4f9c4d26f8b79a38744

Run wmudmount.SlackBuild with VERSION=1.13 set in the environment. It's
not possible to install both versions of wmudmount at the same time.
