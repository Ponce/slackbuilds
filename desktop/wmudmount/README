A filesystem mounter that uses udisks to handle notification of new filesystems and mounting
of the filesystems as a non-root user. It also includes a mode to display the mounted
filesystems with the least free space percentage (similar to wmfsm).

Note: This SlackBuild uses the last version to support GTK2 and UDisks1. The latest versions
are GTK3 and UDisks2 only. I may update this in the future with an optional patch for those
who use GTK2. If you desire the latest version, visit the link to the home page below. The
SlackBuild contains comments on what to change if you want to build version 2.2

I would also accept a patch from anyone who backports the latest version to GTK2.
