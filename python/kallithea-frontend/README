This installs the front-end datas required to run Kallithea.
The same result can be achieved, with npm installed, by running:
# kallithea-cli front-end-build
npm is found on nodejs package available on Slackbuilds.

This package is simply a way to deploy more easily the Kallithea
front-end.  Without having to install nodejs, or to have internet
access.

This is flawed as it is stuck in time, and if npm packages are updated
it won't be reflected here. But there will be a new version for each
new version of Kallithea.
