The stopit python module provides the user with a function that raises an
exception in another thread, including the main thread.  It also provides two
context managers that may stop its inner block activity on timeout and two
decorators that may stop its decorated callables on timeout.

This SlackBuild will build with Python 3 support if it is installed.
