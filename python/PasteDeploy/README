Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI applications and servers.
For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple function (loadapp) for
loading a WSGI application from a configuration file or a Python Egg.
For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single, simple entry point to your
application, so that application users don't need to be exposed to the implementation
details of your application.

The result is something a system administrator can install and manage without knowing
any Python, or the details of the WSGI application or its container.

Paste Deployment currently does not require other parts of Paste, and is distributed
as a separate package.
