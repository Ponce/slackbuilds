A Python package provides a collection of utilities for working with Excel
files. Since these utilities may require either or both of the xlrd and xlwt
packages, they are collected together here, separate from either package.

Currently available are:

xlutils.copy
    Tools for copying xlrd.Book objects to xlwt.Workbook objects.
xlutils.display
		Utility functions for displaying information about xlrd-related objects in
		a user-friendly and safe fashion.
xlutils.filter
		A mini framework for splitting and filtering Excel files into new Excel
		files.
xlutils.margins
    Tools for finding how much of an Excel file contains useful data.
xlutils.save
    Tools for serializing xlrd.Book objects back to Excel files.
xlutils.styles
    Tools for working with formatting information expressed in styles.

Installation

Do the following in your virtualenv:

pip install xlutils
