python3-sge (2d game engine for python3 and pygame)

The Seclusion Game Engine ("SGE", pronounced like "sage") is a
general-purpose libre open source 2-D game engine for Python. It
takes care of several details for you so you can focus on the game
itself. This makes more rapid game development possible, and it also
makes the SGE easy to learn.

SGE was formerly known as "Stellar Game Engine" and "sge-python".

This build of SGE also includes the xSGE extensions.

Optional build-time dependency: Sphinx. If this is installed, the SGE
API documentation will be included in the package. You only need this
if you're developing your own game that uses SGE.
