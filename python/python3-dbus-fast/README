dbus-fast is a Python library for DBus that aims to be a performant
fully featured high level library primarily geared towards integration
of applications into Linux desktop and mobile environments.

Note: Unable to upgrade python3-dbus-fast beyond version 2.45.1.
Newer versions require a newer Python than available in Slackware 15.0
(i.e. at >= 3.10).
