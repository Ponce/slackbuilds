Pygments is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of 
software such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to
prettify source code.

Highlights are:
  * A wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported.
  * Special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount.
  * Support for new languages and formats are added easily.
  * A number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG and ANSI
    sequences.
  * It is usable as a command-line tool and as a library.

In order to build pygments' html documentation files you must install Sphinx
and you need to use "HTML=1 ./Pygments.SlackBuild".
