importlib-resources is a backport of Python standard library
importlib.resources module for older Pythons.

The key goal of this module is to replace parts of pkg_resources with a
solution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs. This makes
reading resources included in packages easier, with more stable and
consistent semantics.

*NOTE*: you have to build the dependencies (python3 excluded) with
python3 already installed.
