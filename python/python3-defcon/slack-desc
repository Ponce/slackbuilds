# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-defcon: python3-defcon (A set of flexible objects for representing UFO data)
python3-defcon:
python3-defcon: Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font editing
python3-defcon: applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast and
python3-defcon: flexible. The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant to
python3-defcon: be end-all, be-all objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base
python3-defcon: functionality so that you can focus on your application's behavior,
python3-defcon: not object observing or maintaining cached data.
python3-defcon: Defcon implements UFO3 as described by the UFO font format.
