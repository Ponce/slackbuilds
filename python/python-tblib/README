A traceback serialization library that allows you to pickle tracebacks and
raise exceptions with pickled tracebacks in different processes. This allows
better error handling when running code over multiple processes (imagine
multiprocessing, billiard, futures, celery etc).  It also parses traceback
strings and raise with the parsed tracebacks.
