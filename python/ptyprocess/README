ptyprocess (python module)

Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with
both the process and its pty.
Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be
a password prompt that doesn’t read from stdin, output that changes
when it’s going to a pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style
interfaces that rely on a terminal.

NOTE: python3 support will be added if python3 is installed.
