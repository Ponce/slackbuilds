Backlash supports both debugging applications on crash and realtime console, both are based on the Werkzeug Debugger and adapted to work with WebOb.

backlash is a swiss army knife for web applications debugging, which provides:
  An Interactive In Browser Debugger based on a Werkzeug Debugger fork ported to WebOb
  Crash reporting by email and on Sentry
  Slow requests reporting by email and on Sentry.

Backlash was born as a replacement for WebError in TurboGears2.3 versions.
