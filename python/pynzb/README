NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet)
servers. Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively easy to build one-off
parsers to parse NZB files. This project is an attempt to consolidate
those many one-off NZB parsers into one simple interface.

This package includes three implementations: one based on expat, another
based on ElementTree, and a final implementation based on lxml. The order
in which they were listed is in order of compatibility. The expat version
should work on all versions of Python > 2.0, the lxml one will work on
all versions > 2.5, and lxml will only work if you have lxml installed.

This requires pysetuptools.
