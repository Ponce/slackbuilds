Paste provides several pieces of "middleware" (or filters) that can be nested to
build web applications.
Each piece of middleware uses the WSGI (PEP 333) interface, and should be
compatible with other middleware based on those interfaces.


Paste is in maintenance mode and recently moved from bitbucket to github.
Patches are accepted to keep it on life support, but for the most part,
please consider using other options.
