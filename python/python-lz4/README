python-lz4: provides python bindings for the LZ4 compression library.

The bindings provided in this package cover the frame format and the block 
format specifications. The frame format bindings are the recommended ones to 
use, as this guarantees interoperability with other implementations and 
language bindings.

The API provided by the frame format bindings follows that of the LZMA, zlib, 
gzip and bzip2 compression libraries which are provided with the Python 
standard library. As such, these LZ4 bindings should provide a drop-in 
alternative to the compression libraries shipped with Python. The package 
provides context managers and file handler support.
