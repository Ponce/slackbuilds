Paste Deployment is a system for finding and configuring WSGI
applications and servers.  For WSGI application consumers it provides a
single, simple function (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a
configuration file or a Python Egg.

For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single, simple entry
point to your application, so that application users don't need to be
exposed to the implementation details of your application.

The result is something a system administrator can install and manage
without knowing any Python, or the details of the WSGI application or
its container.

Paste Deployment currently does not require other parts of Paste, and is
distributed as a separate package.
