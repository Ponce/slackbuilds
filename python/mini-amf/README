Mini-AMF provides Action Message Format serialization and deserialization
support for Python, compatible with the Adobe Flash Player.  It supports
Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

Mini-AMF is a trimmed-down version of PyAMF.  It provides only the core
serialization and deserialization primitives, and support for reading and
writing LSO objects on disk.  Support for Flex-specific types, "remoting", and
integration with web frameworks has all been removed.  (Adapter classes are
still supported.)
