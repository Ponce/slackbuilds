PyDbLite (small footprint untyped database engine in python)

PyDbLite is a pure-Python in-memory database engine, using Python
list comprehensions as query language instead of SQL, which stores
data in a cPickled file.

You can also use PyDbLite with MySQL and SQLite, as backends.
In order to use MySQL's adapter, you will need MySQL-python.
