The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc
approach, or the use of regular expressions.  The pyparsing
module provides a library of classes that client code uses to
construct the grammar directly in Python code.

This is the python3 version of pyparsing and it can coexist with
SBo's pyparsing package.
