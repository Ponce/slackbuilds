PyLyrics is a python module to get Lyrics of songs from 
lyrics.wikia.com. It has support for getting albums of a singer and 
songs from an album from which lyrics can be accessed.

Note:
If you failed at building BeautifulSoup4, you can temporary install
via pip3 although it's not encouraged:
$pip3 install BeautifulSoup4
