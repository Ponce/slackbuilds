APSW is a Python wrapper for the SQLite embedded relational database engine. In
contrast to other wrappers such as pysqlite it focuses on being a minimal layer
over SQLite attempting just to translate the complete SQLite API into Python.
The documentation has a section on the differences between APSW and pysqlite.
APSW supports CPython 2.3 onwards and CPython 3.1 onwards.

Optional dependency: python3

Note: To install python 3 set PYTHON3=yes.

  # PYTHON3=yes ./apsw.SlackBuild
