pyliblo (python wrapper for the liblo OSC library)

pyliblo is a Python wrapper for the liblo Open Sound Control
library. It supports almost the complete functionality of liblo,
allowing you to send and receive OSC messages using a nice and simple
Python API.

This build includes support for both Python 2 and Python 3. Also
included are the command line utilities send_osc and dump_osc.
