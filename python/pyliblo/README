pyliblo (python wrapper for the liblo OSC library)

pyliblo is a Python wrapper for the liblo Open Sound Control library. It
supports almost the complete functionality of liblo, allowing you to
send and receive OSC messages using a nice and simple Python API.

Also included are the command line utilities send_osc and dump_osc.

If you're upgrading from an older pyliblo version and you get 'compilation
terminated due to -Wfatal-errors', check your installed version of liblo:
for pyliblo-0.10.0 and up, you need liblo-0.28 or greater.
