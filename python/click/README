$ click_

Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces
in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It's the "Command
Line Interface Creation Kit". It's highly configurable but comes with
sensible defaults out of the box.

It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and
fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to
implement an intended CLI API.

NOTE: click-8.1.x is the last version to support python-3.9

NOTE:
-Use click-legacy7 if you need click<=8 and/or python2 support

IMPORTANT:
-Conflicts with click-legacy7 and both cannot be installed at the same
 time.
