# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-daemon: the required steps are much the same for every daemon program. A
python2-daemon: DaemonContext instance holds the behaviour and configured process
python2-daemon: environment for the program; use the instance as a context manager
python2-daemon: to enter a daemon state.
