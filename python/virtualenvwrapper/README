virtualenvwrapper (Extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv tool)

virtualenvwrapper is a set of extensions to Ian Bicking's virtualenv
tool for creating isolated Python development environments.

The extensions include wrappers for creating and deleting virtual
environments and otherwise managing your development workflow,
making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without
introducing conflicts in their dependencies.
