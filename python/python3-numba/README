  Numba translates Python functions to optimized machine code at
runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library.
Numba-compiled numerical algorithms in Python can approach the
speeds of C or FORTRAN.

  You don't need to replace the Python interpreter, run a separate
compilation step, or even have a C/C++ compiler installed. Just apply
one of the Numba decorators to your Python function, and Numba does
the rest.
