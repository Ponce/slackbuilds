Cheetah is an open source template engine and code generation tool,
written in Python. It can be used standalone or combined with other
tools and frameworks. Web development is its principle use, but Cheetah
is very flexible and is also being used to generate C++ game code, Java,
sql, form emails and even Python code.

The pysetuptools optional dependecy (available from SlackBuilds.org)
enables outputting a markdown processed template.
