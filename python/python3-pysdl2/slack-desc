# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-pysdl2: python3-pysdl2 (PySDL2 Python3 library)
python3-pysdl2:
python3-pysdl2: PySDL2 is a pure Python wrapper around the SDL2, SDL2_mixer,
python3-pysdl2: SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_gfx libraries. Instead of relying on
python3-pysdl2: C code, it uses the built-in ctypes module to interface with SDL2, and
python3-pysdl2: provides simple Python classes and wrappers for common SDL2
python3-pysdl2: functionality.
