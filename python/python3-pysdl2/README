PySDL2 is a pure Python wrapper around the SDL2, SDL2_mixer, 
SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf, and SDL2_gfx libraries. Instead of relying on C
code, it uses the built-in ctypes module to interface with SDL2, and 
provides simple Python classes and wrappers for common SDL2 
functionality.

This package changed the path to python3.x incase of some of my 
packages dependencies and the sake of Python3.
