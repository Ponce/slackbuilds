Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for
mapping URLs to application actions, and conversely to generate URLs.
Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful
with little effort.

Routes allows conditional matching based on domain, cookies, HTTP
method, or a custom function.
Sub-domain support is built in.
Routes comes with an extensive unit test suite.
