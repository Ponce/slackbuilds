WebOb is a Python library that provides wrappers around the WSGI
request environment, and an object to help create WSGI responses.
The objects map much of the specified behavior of HTTP, including
header parsing, content negotiation and correct handling of
conditional and range requests.

This helps you create rich applications and valid middleware
without knowing all the complexities of WSGI and HTTP.
