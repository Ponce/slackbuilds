Sphinx extension to support docstrings in Numpy format.
Numpy's documentation uses several custom extensions to Sphinx.
These are shipped in this numpydoc package, in case you want to
make use of them in third-party projects.

python3-numpydoc 1.6.0 is the last available version for Slackware 15.0.
Newer versions require Sphinx >= 6.
