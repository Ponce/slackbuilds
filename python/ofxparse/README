ofxparse is a parser for Open Financial Exchange (.ofx) format
files. OFX files are available from almost any online banking
site, so they work well if you want to pull together your finances
from multiple sources. Online trading accounts also provide account
statements in OFX files.

There are three different types of OFX files, called BankAccount,
CreditAccount and InvestmentAccount files. This library has been
tested with real-world samples of all three types.
