# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dulwich: dulwich (Python implementation of Git formats and protocols)
dulwich:
dulwich: Dulwich is a Python implementation of the Git file formats and
dulwich: protocols.  It aims to give an interface to git repos (both local and
dulwich: remote) that doesn't call out to git directly but instead uses pure
dulwich: Python.  The project is named after the village in which Mr. and
dulwich: Mrs. Git live in the Monty Python sketch.
