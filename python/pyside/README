PySide is a LGPL licensed python binding that allow access of Qt
libraries, making them available just using the import command.

The build process is comprised of two stages: in a first moment the
bindings source code are created from the Qt 4.6 headers by calling the
Generator Runner with appropriate parameters; the generated files are
then compiled and linked together to form the bindings libraries.

This requires generatorrunner and shiboken.
