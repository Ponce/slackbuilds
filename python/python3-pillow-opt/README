python3-pillow-opt (Python Imaging Library, new version)

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities
to your Python environment. This library provides extensive file
format support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful
image processing capabilities.

This version of pillow installs to /opt/python3.9/, so it won't
conflict with Slackware's older python-pillow package. This is the
newest version of pillow that will work with Python 3.9 (please don't
ask for an update to >= 12.0.0).

Any SlackBuild for a python3 program that requires this version of
pillow will have to modify the python script itself. Add the following
code:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0,'/opt/python3.9/site-packages')

If there's already an 'import sys', just put the insert() line right
after it.

Note: the API documentation is not installed as part of the package.
