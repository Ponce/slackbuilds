# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-turbogears2: and Rails.
python3-turbogears2:
python3-turbogears2: All of these frameworks had limitations that frustrated us, and TG2
python3-turbogears2: was built as an answer to that frustration.
