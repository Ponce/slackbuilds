SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become
a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the
code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily
extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require
any external libraries.

SymPy has several optional dependencies which enhance its functionality
or make it faster. Here are those available at SlackBuilds.org:
numpy3, scipy3, python3-matplotlib, and ipython

This is the python3 version of SymPy. For the python2 version use the
sympy package.
