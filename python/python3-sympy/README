SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a
full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as
simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible.
SymPy is written entirely in Python and does require just mpmath as an
external library.

SymPy has several optional dependencies which enhance its functionality
or make it faster. Here are those available at SlackBuilds.org: numpy3,
scipy3, python3-matplotlib, ipython and pyglet.

This is the python3 and more andvanced version of SymPy. For the older
python2 version use the sympy package.
