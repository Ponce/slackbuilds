PyMuPDF adds Python bindings and abstractions to MuPDF, a lightweight
PDF, XPS, and eBook viewer, renderer, and toolkit. Both PyMuPDF and
MuPDF are maintained and developed by Artifex Software, Inc.

MuPDF can access files in PDF, XPS, OpenXPS, CBZ, EPUB and FB2 (eBooks)
formats, and it is known for its top performance and exceptional
rendering quality.

With PyMuPDF you can access files with extensions like .pdf, .xps,
.oxps, .cbz, .fb2 or .epub. In addition, about 10 popular image formats
can also be handled like documents: .png, .jpg, .bmp, .tiff, etc.

krop (available on SBo) can use PyMuPDF for both rendering and cropping.

To be on the safe side, keep the version of python3-PyMuPDF in sync with
the mupdf version.

Optional autodetected dependencies are python-fonttools, tesseract, and
python3-pymupdf_fonts.
