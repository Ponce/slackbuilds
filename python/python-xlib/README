The Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client
library for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in
contrast to earlier X libraries for Python which were interfaces to
the C Xlib.

This is possible to do since X client programs communicate with the X
server via the X protocol. The communication takes place over TCP/IP,
Unix sockets, DECnet or any other streaming network protocol. The C
Xlib is merely an interface to this protocol, providing functions
suitable for a C environment.

Python3 is an optional dependency and python3-six is required if built
with python3 support.

setuptools-scm is only required as a build dependency and can be
skipped if you would rather have it automatically grabbed from
pypi.python.org during the build process.
