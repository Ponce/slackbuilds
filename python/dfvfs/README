dfvfs (Digital Forensics Virtual File System - python module)

This package provides read-only access to file-system objects from various 
storage media types and file formats. The goal of dfVFS is to provide a generic
interface for accessing file-system objects, for which it uses several 
back-ends that provide the actual implementation of the various storage media 
types, volume systems and file systems.

A note about REQUIREMENTS:  dfvfs requires the following packages [secondary
dependancies are listed in brackets].  They should be installed IN THE ORDER
LISTED. This is important because while libewf support is optional for the
sleuthkit (a requirement for pytsk), it is a REQUIRED option for the sleuthkit
when building dfvfs.  Do NOT rely on automated tools to properly order your
dependancies.

REQUIRES="[six] construct [pysetuptools] [python-gflags] [python-dateutil]
