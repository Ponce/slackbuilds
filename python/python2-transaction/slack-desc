# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-transaction: python2-transaction (Python Transaction Management)
python2-transaction:
python2-transaction: This is a generic transaction implementation for Python. It
python2-transaction: is mainly used by the ZODB.  Note that the data manager API,
python2-transaction: transaction.interfaces.IDataManager, is syntactically simple, but
python2-transaction: semantically complex. The semantics were not easy to express in the
python2-transaction: interface. The semantics are presented in detail through examples
python2-transaction: of a sample data manager in transaction.tests.test_SampleDataManager.
