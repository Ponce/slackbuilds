billiard is a fork of the Python 2.7 multiprocessing package.
The multiprocessing package itself is a renamed and updated version of
R Oudkerk's pyprocessing package.
This standalone variant draws its fixes/improvements from python-trunk
and provides additional bug fixes and improvements.

* This package would not be possible if not for the contributions of not
  only the current maintainers but all of the contributors to the
  original pyprocessing package listed here.
* Also, it is a fork of the multiprocessing backport package by
  Christian Heims.
* It includes the no-execv patch contributed by R. Oudkerk.
* And the Pool improvements previously located in Celery.
* Billiard is used in and is a dependency for Celery and is maintained
  by the Celery team.
