This library provides a pure python interface for the Twitter API.

Twitter (http://twitter.com) provides a service that allows people
to connect via the web, IM, and SMS. Twitter exposes a web services
API (http://twitter.com/help/api) and this library is intended to
make it even easier for python programmers to use.
