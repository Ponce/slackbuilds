Python Bindings for the MusicBrainz XML Web Service.

This python package contains various modules for accessing the MusicBrainz
web service, as well as parsing the MusicBrainz Metadata XML (MMD), or
calculating DiscIDs from Audio CDs.

If you'd like to generate and install the python-musicbrainz2 API documents,
then install epydoc and pass MAKE_DOCS=yes to the Slackbuild.
