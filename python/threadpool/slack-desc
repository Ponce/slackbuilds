# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

threadpool:
threadpool: A thread pool is an object that maintains a pool of worker threads to
threadpool: perform time consuming operations in parallel. It assigns jobs to the
threadpool: threads by putting them in a work request queue, where they are picked
threadpool: up by the next available thread. This then performs the requested
threadpool: operation in the background and puts the results in another queue.
