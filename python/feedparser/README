feedparser is a Python utility library to parse RSS and Atom feeds.

Since update to version 6.0.8, along with sgmllib being dropped from python3
it is now necessary to manually add necessary sgml support by running (as root):
	python3 -m pip install sgmllib3k

This will enable 'import feedparser' to work as expected with python3
until a SlackBuild for sgmllib3k is able to be included at SBo.
