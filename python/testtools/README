Extensions to the Python standard library unit testing framework

testtools is a set of extensions to the Python standard libraryâ€™s unit
testing framework. These extensions have been derived from many years of
experience with unit testing in Python and come from many different
sources.

Note: There is a cyclic dependency between fixtures package and
testtools package.  Since these are python libraries, one has to just
install both of them.
