The pytest testing tool makes it easy to write small tests, yet
scales to support complex functional testing.

This is installed with python3.

IMPORTANT: The scripts py.test and pytest are renamed to py.test3
and pytest3 respectively to avoid conflicts with the pytest installed
with python.

NOTE: py, pluggy and iniconfig have automatic python3 support.
