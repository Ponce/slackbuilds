Pyinotify is a Python module for monitoring filesystems changes.
Pyinotify relies on a Linux Kernel feature (merged in kernel 2.6.13)
called inotify. inotify is an event-driven notifier, its notifications
are exported from kernel space to user space through three system calls.

Optional dependencies: pysetuptools and python3

Note: To install python3 bindings pass the variable PYTHON3=yes to the
slackbuild.

  # PYTHON3=yes ./pyinotify.SlackBuild
