Python interface for Berkeley DB

This module provides a nearly complete wrapping of the
Oracle/Sleepycat C API for the Database Environment, Database,
Cursor, Sequence and Transaction objects, and each of these is
exposed as a Python type in the bsddb3.db module. The database
objects can use various access methods: btree, hash, recno, and
queue. Complete support of Berkeley DB distributed transactions.
Complete support for Berkeley DB Replication Manager. Complete
support for Berkeley DB Base Replication. Support for RPC.


python3 is an optional dependency.  You need to set PYTHON3=yes,
for example:

  PYTHON3=yes ./bsddb3.SlackBuild
