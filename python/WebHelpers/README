WebHelpers is a wide variety of utility functions for web applications and other
applications.
It can be used with any web framework.

WebHelpers includes the widely-used HTML tag builder with smart escaping and
convenience functions for common tags such as form fields.
The common builder ensures the tags are syntactically correct and prevent
cross-site scripting attacks and double-escaping.

Other helpers perform text processing, split a large number of records into
pages, generate Atom/RSS feeds with geographical (GIS) data, handle MIME types,
calculate numerica statistics, and more.
There are also high-level container types, including a value counter and
accumulator.
There are lists of country names, country codes, US states, Canadian provinces,
and UK counties.
