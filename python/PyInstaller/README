PyInstaller is a program that converts (packages) Python programs into
stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and AIX.
Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with
any version of Python since 2.4, it builds smaller executables thanks to
transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support
to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.
