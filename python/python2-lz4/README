python-lz4: provides python bindings for the LZ4 compression library.

The bindings provided in this package cover the frame format and the
block format specifications. The frame format bindings are the
recommended ones to use, as this guarantees interoperability with other
implementations and language bindings.

The API provided by the frame format bindings follows that of the LZMA,
zlib, gzip and bzip2 compression libraries which are provided with the
Python standard library. As such, these LZ4 bindings should provide a
drop-in alternative to the compression libraries shipped with Python.
The package provides context managers and file handler support.
