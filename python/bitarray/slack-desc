# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

bitarray: Bitarray (Efficient arrays of booleans -- C extension)
bitarray: 
bitarray: This module provides an object type which efficiently represents an
bitarray: array of booleans. Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very much
bitarray: like usual lists. Eight bits are represented by one byte in a
bitarray: contiguous block of memory.
