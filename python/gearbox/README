Gearbox is a paster command replacement for TurboGears2.
It has been created during the process of providing Python3 support to the
TurboGears2 web framework, while still being backward compatible with the
existing TurboGears projects.

Gearbox is based on a stripped down version of Cliff command line framework,
you might want to consider Cliff for more advanced use cases and custom
command interpreters.
