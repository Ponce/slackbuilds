Gearbox is a paster command replacement for TurboGears2.
It has been created during the process of providing Python3 support to
the TurboGears2 web framework, while still being backward compatible
with the existing TurboGears projects.

Gearbox is based on a stripped down version of Cliff command line
framework, you might want to consider Cliff for more advanced use cases
and custom command interpreters.
