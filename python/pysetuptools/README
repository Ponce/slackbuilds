pysetuptools (a collection of enhancements to Python distutils)
Note: the name of the source package is 'setuptools'.  Since
'setuptools' is such a generic name, this package uses the name
'pysetuptools' to avoid any potential future conflicts.  The actual
installation paths and file names are not modified in any way.

setuptools allow you to more easily build and distribute Python
packages, especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.
