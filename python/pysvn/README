The pysvn project's goal is to enable tools to be written in Python that
use Subversion.

Some pysvn extension features:
 + Supports all svn client features
 + Supports svn transaction features required to write svn pre-commit hooks
 + Easy to learn and use
 + Python like interface
 + Good Documentation and examples
 + No need to understand the Subversion C API

This requires pycxx.
