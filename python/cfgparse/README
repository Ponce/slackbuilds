cfgparse is a more convenient, flexible, and powerful module for parsing
configuration files than the standard library ConfigParser module. cfgparse
uses a more declarative style modelled after the popular optparse standard
library module.

cfgparse can optionally cooperate with the optparse module to provide
coordination between command line and configuration file options. In addition,
the cooperation can be used to allow the user to control features of the
parser from the command line.
