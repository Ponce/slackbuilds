Soup Sieve is a CSS selector library designed to be used with
Beautiful Soup 4. It aims to provide selecting, matching, and
filtering using modern CSS selectors.

Soup Sieve 1.9.6 is the last supported version for Python 2. Newer
versions (i.e. The python3-soupsieve SlackBuild) have dropped
Python 2 support.
