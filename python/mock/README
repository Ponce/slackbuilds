mock (unit test library for Python 2)

mock is a library for testing in Python 2. It allows you to replace
parts of your system under test with mock objects, and to make
assertions about how they have been used.

IMPORTANT: For Python3 you do not need this module. Please use the
standard library instead (unittest.mock). This package contains a
rolling backport of the standard library compatible with Python 2.7.
