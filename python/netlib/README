Netlib is a collection of network utility classes, used by the pathod
and mitmproxy projects. It differs from other projects in some
fundamental respects, because both pathod and mitmproxy often need to
violate standards. This means that protocols are implemented as small,
well-contained and flexible functions, and are designed to allow
misbehaviour when needed.
