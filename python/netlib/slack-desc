# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

netlib:
netlib: Netlib is a collection of network utility classes, used by the
netlib: pathod and mitmproxy projects. It differs from other projects in
netlib: some fundamental respects, because both pathod and mitmproxy often
netlib: need to violate standards. This means that protocols are implemented
netlib: as small, well-contained and flexible functions, and are designed to
netlib: allow misbehaviour when needed.
