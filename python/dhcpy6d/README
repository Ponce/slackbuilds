Dhcpy6d delivers IPv6 addresses for DHCPv6 clients, which can be
identified by DUID, hostname or MAC address as in the good old IPv4
days. It allows easy dualstack transistion, addresses may be generated
randomly, by range, by arbitrary ID or MAC address. Clients can get
more than one address, leases and client configuration can be stored
in databases and DNS can be updated dynamically.

MySQL-python and dnspython are optional dependencies.
