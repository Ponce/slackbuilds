PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
cryptographic primitives.  It supports Python 2.6 or newer, all Python 3
versions and PyPy.  PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto.

PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like OpenSSL.  To
the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block
ciphers) are implemented as C extensions.
