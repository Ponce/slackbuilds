PySnooper is a poor man's debugger for Python.

PySnooper lets you inspect variables and see which lines are running without
the need for a debugger, breakpoints or print statements. To use PySnooper, add
one decorator line to the function you're interested in. You'll get a
play-by-play log of your function, including which lines ran and when, and
exactly when local variables were changed.
