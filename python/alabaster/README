A configurable sidebar-enabled Sphinx theme

Alabaster is a visually (c)lean, responsive, configurable theme
for the Sphinx documentation system. It is Python 2+3 compatible.

It began as a third-party theme, and is still maintained separately,
but as of Sphinx 1.3, Alabaster is an install-time dependency
of Sphinx and is selected as the default theme.

Live examples of this theme can be seen on this project's own
website, paramiko.org, fabfile.org and pyinvoke.org.

For more documentation, please see http://alabaster.readthedocs.io.

Optional dependency: python3 (automatically detected)
