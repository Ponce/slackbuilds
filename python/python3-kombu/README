Kombu is a messaging library for Python.

The aim of Kombu is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQ protocol, and
also provide proven and tested solutions to common messaging problems.

AMQP is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol
for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security, for
which the RabbitMQ messaging server is the most popular implementation.
