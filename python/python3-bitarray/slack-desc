# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-bitarray: python3-bitarray (efficient arrays of booleans)
python3-bitarray:
python3-bitarray: This library provides an object type which efficiently represents an
python3-bitarray: array of booleans. Bitarrays are sequence types and behave very much
python3-bitarray: like usual lists. Eight bits are represented by one byte in a
python3-bitarray: contiguous block of memory. The user can select between two
python3-bitarray: representations: little-endian and big-endian. All functionality is
python3-bitarray: implemented in C.
