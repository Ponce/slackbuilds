LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API. It requires at
least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

LLFUSE was originally part of S3QL, but has been factored out so that it can
be used by other projects as well.

The SlackBuild detects presence of Python 3.x and if found,
then also bindings for Python 3.x are built.
