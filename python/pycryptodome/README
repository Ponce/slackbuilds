PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level cryptographic
primitives.  It supports Python 2.6 or newer, all Python 3 versions and PyPy.
PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto.

PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like OpenSSL.  To the
largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.  Only the
pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers) are
implemented as C extensions.
