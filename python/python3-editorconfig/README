python3-editorconfig (meta-configuration for text editors)

EditorConfig Python Core provides the same functionality as the
EditorConfig C Core. EditorConfig Python core can be used as a command
line program or as an importable library.

EditorConfig makes it easy to maintain the correct coding style
when switching between different text editors and between different
projects. The EditorConfig project maintains a file format and
plugins for various text editors which allow this file format to be
read and used by those editors.
