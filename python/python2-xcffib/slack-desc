# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python2-xcffib: python2-xcffib (XCB python binding)
python2-xcffib:
python2-xcffib: xcffib is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for xpyb.
python2-xcffib: xpyb has an inactive upstream, several memory leaks, is python2 only
python2-xcffib: and doesn't have pypy support. xcffib is a binding which uses cffi,
python2-xcffib: which mitigates some of the issues described above. xcffib also
python2-xcffib: builds bindings for 27 of the 29 (xprint and xkb are missing)
python2-xcffib: X extensions in 1.10.
