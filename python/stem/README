stem is a Python controller library for Tor

stem is compatible with python 2.6+ (including python 3)

Having Tor installed is not required for building.
The Tor installation does not have to be from SBo.

Sphinx is an optional dependency to create proper documentation.
In order to do so, pass DOC=yes to the script.
