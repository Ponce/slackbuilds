PyXB ("pixbee") is a pure Python package that generates Python source code
for classes that correspond to data structures defined by XMLSchema.
The generated classes support bi-directional conversion between XML documents
and Python objects. In concept it is similar to JAXB for Java and CodeSynthesis
XSD for C++.
