SimPy is a process-based discrete-event simulation language based on standard
Python and released under the GNU LGPL.

It provides the modeller with components of a simulation model. These include
processes for active components like customers, messages and vehicles as well
as  resources for passive components that form limited capacity congestion
points (like servers, checkout counters and tunnels). It also provides monitor
variables to aid in gathering statistics. SimPy comes with extensive plotting
capabilities.

The distribution contains in-depth documentation, tutorials, and a large number
of simulation models.
