Mumble is a voice chat application for groups. While it can be used
for any kind of activity, it is primarily intended for gaming. It
can be compared to programs like Ventrilo or TeamSpeak. 

If you have g15tools installed and want mumble to use it:
    G15=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

If you want the mumble overlay:
    OVERLAY=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

If your system is x86_64 based, you can have this script build a
32-bit libmumble. This will add in a 32-bit library for the
mumble-overlay script to use for compatability. Please note, you
*must* have a multilibbed system for this to work.

To build the overlay with 32-bit compatability:
    OVERLAY=yes COMPAT32=yes ./mumble.SlackBuild

Note: This does not build the mumble server (murmur).

***NOTE: text-to-speech is now an available option in mumble with
SPEECHD=yes and requires additional optional dependencies:
You will need one text-to-speech engine installed. For example:
flite
festival
espeak
