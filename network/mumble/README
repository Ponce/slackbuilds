Mumble is a voice chat application for groups. It has low latency and 
superb voice quality. While it can be used for any kind of activity, 
it is primarily intended for gaming. It features an ingame overlay for 
OpenGL based games, showing clearly who is talking even for fullscreen 
applications.

Mumble requires qt4, boost, and sqlite (available on SlackBuilds.org).
