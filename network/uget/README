uGet is a Free and Open Source download manager.

It allows for queuing downloads, file type-based classification of
downloads, and is lightweight.

Optionally, uget can be compiled with support for the optional dependency
aria2. This is autodetected at build time. You can forcibly disable
aria2 support by passing ARIA2=no to the script.

uGet can also be compiled without support for notifications. To do this,
pass LIBNOTIFY=no to the script.

If you're upgrading from uGet 1.x, run "uget-gtk-1to2" to convert your
old settings in ~/.config/uGet to the format used by uGet 2.x.
