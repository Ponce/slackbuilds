uget (download manager with GTK GUI)

uGet is a Free and Open Source download manager.

It allows for queuing downloads, file type-based classification of
downloads, and is lightweight.

By default, uGet uses curl for downloads. If desired, uGet can use
aria2 instead. To do this, install aria2, then launch uGet and choose
"Edit => Settings => Plug-in => Plug-in matching order", and select
"aria2". There's no need to rebuild uGet after installing aria2: it's
an optional run-time dependency.

uGet can be compiled without support for notifications, since some users
find them annoying. To do this, pass LIBNOTIFY=no to the script.

uGet can also be compiled without support for gstreamer. This will stop
the "Sound when download is finished" option from working. To do this,
pass GSTREAMER=no to the script.

If you're upgrading from uGet 1.x, run "uget-gtk-1to2" to convert your
old settings in ~/.config/uGet to the format used by uGet 2.x.

The status line at the top of the uGet window is intended to announce
new releases of uGet, but it's currently "stuck" and claims that 2.0.8
is a "new stable release". Upstream is working on the problem; please
just ignore the status line for now.
