.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
sntpc [\fB\-bhnv\fP] [\fB\-p\fP \fIport\fP] [\fB\-s\fP \fIserver\fP] [\fB\-t\fP \fIthreshold\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsntpc\fP queries an NTP server for the current time, and sets the
local clock to the time reported by the server. It\(aqs a standalone
binary, with no config file and no dependency on the \fIntp\fP package.
.sp
\fBsntpc\fP does not run as a daemon like \fBntpd\fP does. To keep
the time in sync, you can run \fBsntpc\fP from root\(aqs \fBcrontab\fP(1)
every 30 minutes (or however often it\(aqs necessary).
.sp
\fBsntpc\fP requires root access to actually set the local clock,
although it can be run with \fB\-n\fP by non\-privileged users (e.g. with
\fB\-v\fP to simply check the local time against the server\(aqs time).
.SH OPTIONS
