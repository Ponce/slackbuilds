jabberd 2.x project is the next generation of the jabberd project. It
has been rewritten from the ground up to be scalable, architecturally
sound and to support the latest protocol extensions coming out of the XSF.

Please note: jabberd 2.x is not a newer version of jabberd 1.x but a
completely different project.
