LogMeIn Hamachi2 is a hosted VPN service that securely connects devices and
networks, extending LAN-like network connectivity to mobile users,
distributed teams and business applications. You can easily create secure
virtual networks on demand, across public and private networks.

This requires the "tun" driver to be built into the kernel or available as
a module- not a problem for Slackware (indeed, most) kernels.

Provided is a sample rc.d script, /etc/rc.d/rc.d/rc.hamachi, to start the
Hamachi2 daemon. To run it on boot, make it executable with

    chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.hamachi

and add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.hamachi ]; then
      . /etc/rc.d/rc.hamachi start
    fi

Hamachi2 writes its configuration information to /var/lib/logmein-hamachi.
To modify the server configuration, add your parameters to
/var/lib/logmein-hamachi/h2-engine-override.cfg and restart the daemon with
/etc/rc.d/rc.hamachi restart. Parameters you can change (in fact, the
daemon's current configuration) are listed in h2-engine.cfg in this
directory.

Example /var/lib/logmein-hamachi/h2-engine-override.cfg:

    Conn.DisableUpnp    1
    Ipc.User        vike
    Sock.TcpAddr    192.168.1.33
    Sock.TcpPort    51232
    Sock.UdpAddr    192.168.1.33
    Sock.UdpPort    51232

This config allows the user vike to use the hamachi command for controlling
the vpn. It also disables UPnP for negotiation of the hamachi listen socket
and forces it to the address and port listed. This is useful when you are
willing to do a port forward yourself, because UPnP can be unreliable.

For more information run the hamachi command without parameters and see
/usr/doc/hamachi-<version>/README.
