wicd is a wired and wireless network manager for Linux.

Some features include:
- Ability to connect to wired and wireless networks
- Profiles for each wireless network and wired network
- Many encryption schemes, some of which include WEP/WPA/WPA2
- Compatible with wireless-tools 

You will need to start the wicd service at boot by adding the following 
to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.wicd ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.wicd start
	fi

This should default to using dhcpcd after installation unless you have a 
previous installation that uses dhclient; in that case, you will have a 
.new file lying around in /etc/wicd/ to remove.

You need to stop wicd before upgrading the package if you have a previous 
version installed, and be sure to restart it after the upgrade.

If you are upgrading from wicd-1.4.x, the migration script might be useful.
However, it is untested and comes with no guarantees - back up first.
