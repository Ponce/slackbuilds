Shorewall (Iptables Made Easy)

The Shoreline Firewall, more commonly known as "Shorewall", is a 
Netfilter (iptables) based firewall that can be used on a dedicated
firewall system, a multi-function gateway/router/server or on a 
standalone GNU/Linux system.

This is the replacement for shorewall-common and shorewall-perl.
Shorewall-shell support has been dropped from 4.4. If you are upgrading
from versions 4.2 and below make sure you read the documentation, as a
lot has changed.

This requires xtables-addons to use the new per-IP accounting feature.
