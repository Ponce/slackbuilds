Basilisk (Web browser -- BUILD FROM SOURCE)

Note: this builds Basilisk from source and conflicts with the binary
repackage also found on SBo.

Basilisk is a demonstration program for the Unified XUL Platform (XUP).
It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

Some build time options:

  GTK=gtk2 ./basilisk-src.SlackBuild

will override the default and build with gtk2 instead of gtk3.

jack-audio-connection-kit is an optional dependency and, if detected,
automatically built. If this is undesirable you can blacklist jack, by
passing the variable:

  BLACKLIST_JACK=yes ./basilisk-src.SlackBuild
