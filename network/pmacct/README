Pmacct is a small set of multi-purpose passive network monitoring tools.
It can account, classify, aggregate, replicate and export forwarding-plane
data, ie. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; collect and correlate control-plane data via
BGP and BMP; collect infrastructure data via Streaming Telemetry.

Each component works both as a standalone daemon and as a thread of execution
for correlation purposes (ie. enrich NetFlow with BGP data).
