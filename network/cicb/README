cicb (ICB client)

ICB (International CB) is a teleconferencing system that allows Internet
users to participate in realtime online discussions (similar to IRC). This
package builds a client program (called, strangely enough, "icb") that
is used to access ICB.

icb has extensive built-in help, accessed by the /help command.
