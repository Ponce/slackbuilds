cicb (ICB client)

ICB (International CB) is a teleconferencing system that allows
Internet users to participate in realtime online discussions (similar
to IRC). This package builds a client program (called, strangely
enough, "icb") that is used to access ICB.

icb has extensive built-in help, accessed by the /help command.
