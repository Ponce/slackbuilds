nmh (new MH) is a powerful electronic mail handling system.  nmh
consists of a collection of fairly simple single-purpose programs
to send, receive, save, retrieve, and manipulate e-mail
messages. Since nmh is a suite rather than a single monolithic
program, you may freely intersperse nmh commands with other
commands at your shell prompt, or write custom scripts which use
these commands in flexible ways.

This build includes configure options for setting up nmh with GNU
Emacs' MH-E frontend.
