Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer virtual switch licensed
under the open source Apache 2.0 license.  It is designed to enable
massive network automation through programmatic extension, while still
supporting standard management interfaces (e.g. NetFlow, sFlow, RSPAN,
ERSPAN,  CLI).  In addition, it is designed to support distribution
across multiple physical servers similar to VMware.s vNetwork distributed
vswitch or Cisco.s Nexus 1000V.

Open vSwitch can operate both as a soft switch running within the
hypervisor, and as the control stack for switching silicon. It has been
ported to multiple virtualization platforms and switching chipsets. It
is the default switch in the Xen Cloud Platform and also supports Xen,
XenServer, KVM, and VirtualBox. The bulk of the code is written in
platform-independent C and is easily ported to other environments.

NOTE: In order to remain compatible with newer versions of Slackware this
      build script will check for the existence of the Slackware provided
      openvswitch.ko kernel module.  If the kernel module already exists
      on the machine then the script will skip installation of the module
      file.  Open vSwitch utilities are always installed.
