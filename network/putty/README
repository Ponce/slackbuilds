PuTTY is a free implementation of Telnet and SSH for Win32 and Unix
platforms, along with an xterm terminal emulator. It is written and
maintained primarily by Simon Tatham.

PLEASE NOTE: The PuTTY package conflicts with pssh in Slackware. If 
you install PuTTY, you'll overwrite the /usr/bin/pscp and /usr/bin/pssh
binary. After removing PuTTY, you will have to reinstall pssh (n series) again.
