Csync is a file synchronizer especially designed for you, the normal user.

To be more precise csync is a client only bidirectional file synchronizer. 
You can use csync for different things.  The intention is to provide Roaming 
Home Directories for Linux but you can use it to synchronize your music 
collection or create a backup of a directory.

Csync requires log4c, iniparser, and check.
