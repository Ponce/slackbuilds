Apache Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to 
build services that work efficiently and seamlessly among C++, Java, Python, 
PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, Smalltalk, and OCaml.

Other languages are not included because either they are not included in a 
standard installation of Slackware, or because the standard way of installing 
Thrift for that language is not via system packages; for example:
 - Perl: install from CPAN
 - PHP: bundle the Thrift source in your application
 - Ruby: install with 'gem'
You will still need the Thrift compiler from this package.

There are usage examples for more langauges at
http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/ThriftUsage

libevent is an optional dependency; if it is installed, a C++ non-blocking 
server library will be built.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
