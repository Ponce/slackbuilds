# Patch the configuration script. We need this in order to be able to
# run the script from outside the source directory as well. We're going
# to (1) change from relative to absolute the paths to the environment
# file and firewall executable; (2) rename and change the path to the
# startup script (this is for better consistency with Slackware's init
# system); (3) change the path to the unmodified copy of the config
# file, needed to check for existing custom setups. We will NOT create
# a Slackware-compliant /etc/rc.d/rc.firewall symlink to the startup
# script, as this should be done manually by the sysadmin. We won't 
# create any SystemV-style symlinks either. (4) We will allow the script
# to be run correctly more than once, by removing previously set values
# if no value is entered: this is to prevent e.g. ports from remaining
# open, or internal interfaces from remaining enabled with NAT. Finally
# (5) we append the note, picked from the original installation script
# and slightly enhanced, that the user will see when configuration is
# done: this is to inform that an rc.firewall symlink has to be created
# in order to start up the firewall at boot-time in a proper way.
