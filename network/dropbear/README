dropbear (SSH server and client)

Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a
variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly
useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as 
wireless routers.

Please note that this package conflicts with OpenSSH's scp binary.
Installing this package will overwrite this file with a symbolic link
to the dropbearmulti binary, so a backup of /usr/bin/scp will be made
if it exists. After uninstalling dropbear, you can restore the backup
with 'mv /usr/bin/scp.openssh /usr/bin/scp'.
