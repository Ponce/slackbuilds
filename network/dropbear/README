dropbear (SSH server and client)

Dropbear is a relatively small SSH 2 server and client. It runs on a
variety of POSIX-based platforms. Dropbear is open source software,
distributed under a MIT-style license. Dropbear is particularly
useful for "embedded"-type Linux (or other Unix) systems, such as
wireless routers.

Please note the Dropbear distribution includes a standalone version of
OpenSSH's scp program. This SlackBuild will NOT link this by default,
thus creating a package which will not conflict with OpenSSH's scp
binary.

If you want to link dropbear's scp binary, use:

    WITH_SCP=yes ./dropbear.SlackBuild

Installing the package built with WITH_SCP=yes will overwrite
this file with a symbolic link to the dropbearmulti binary, so a
backup of /usr/bin/scp will be made if it exists. After uninstalling
dropbear, you can restore the backup with 'mv /usr/bin/scp.openssh
/usr/bin/scp'.

Installing the package built with WITH_SCP=no will create a
symbolic link /usr/bin/scp.dropbear pointing to the dropbearmulti
binary.
