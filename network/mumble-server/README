mumble-sever is the VoIP server component for Mumble. Murmur is
installed in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by
individual users. Each mumble-server process supports multiple virtual
servers, each with their own user base and channel list.
Administration of mumble-server is done through D-Bus.

This script requires the system to have a mumble-server user and group:

  # groupadd -g 261 murmur
  # useradd -g murmur -u 261 -d /var/lib/mumble-server -s /bin/false murmur

To use a different user and/or group:

  # MURMUR_USER=user MURMUR_GROUP=group ./mumble-server.SlackBuild

To run mumble-server at boot:

  # chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.mumble-server

  Add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.mumble-server ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.mumble-server start
  fi

Note that the project changed the name from murmurd to mumble-server.
Not all of the upstream documentation has been updated yet.

Notes: 
- This does not build the mumble client (mumble).
- For wget github download, you may need to use:
  wget --content-disposition ...
