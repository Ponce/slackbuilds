Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance 
computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It is based on a hierarchical
design targeted at federations of clusters.

1. This SlackBuild is just going to build Ganglia without 'gmetad', which 
   collects information from ganglia monitor clients, and writes them to RRD
   databases. If you want to enable this, you'll have to enable it with the 
   OPT variable and 'gmetad' as value, then execute the build script as 
   follows:    OPT=gmetad ./ganglia.SlackBuild

   In order to build gmetad as part of this package, you'll need to have 
   RRDTool installed.  It is available from SlackBuilds.org.

2. The Ganglia web frontend files will be stored under /var/gweb directory. 
   You can set WWWPATH to the desired place for your web server.
   Example:    WWWPATH=/var/www/ganglia ./ganglia.SlackBuild
