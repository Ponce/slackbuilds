# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

nethogs: NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic
nethogs: down per protocol or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups
nethogs: bandwidth by process. NetHogs does not rely on a special kernel
nethogs: module to be loaded. If there's suddenly a lot of network traffic,
nethogs: you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing
nethogs: this. This makes it easy to indentify programs that have gone wild
nethogs: and are suddenly taking up your bandwidth.
