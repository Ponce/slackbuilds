Tor is a toolset for a wide range of organizations and people that want
to improve their safety and security on the Internet. Using Tor can help
you anonymize web browsing and publishing, instant messaging, IRC,
SSH, and other applications that use the TCP protocol. Tor also
provides a platform on which software developers can build new
applications with built-in anonymity, safety, and privacy features.

This script requires a 'tor' user/group to exist before running.
The recommended UID/GID is 220. You can create these like so:
  groupadd -g 220 tor
  useradd -u 220 -g 220 -c "The Onion Router" -d /dev/null \
  -s /bin/false tor

You can pass another user/group to the script; this is however, less
safe:
  TOR_USER=nobody TOR_GROUP=nogroup sh tor.SlackBuild

The following can be used to start/stop tor automatically:
In file /etc/rc.d/rc.local, add following
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tor ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.tor start
  fi

In /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown, add following
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.tor ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.tor stop
  fi

torsocks is an optional dependency. See README.SLACKWARE for more
information.

optional dependencies:
- zstd for better compression ratios.
- nacl may provide faster performance on 32-bit systems.

Take a look at README.SLACKWARE for important notes and read also very
carefully the essential hints that tor developers give you
