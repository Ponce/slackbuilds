bitcoin (P2P electronic cash system)

Bitcoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system
that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central
server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own
money and transact directly with each other, with the help of
a P2P network to check for double-spending.

This requires: qrencode

UPNP is disabled, it requires miniupnpc, which is not available on SBo.
