Adds Skype client-less chat (text only) to Pidgin using the SkypeWeb protocol. Has many features already,
such as group chat.

A copy of the of the GitHub repo is hosted on my website, dated with the last commit date (will be updated
weekly). I only have mirrored it and made a tarball of the skypeweb folder (rather than the whole repo).
Nothing else was changed.
