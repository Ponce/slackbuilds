GQ is a GTK+ LDAP client and browser utility. It can be used for searching a
LDAP directory as well as browsing it using a tree view. Furthermore, it lets
you inspect the LDAP schema a server is using. 

Install gq if you need a graphical tool to manage the contents of a LDAP server.

This requires gnome-keyring.
