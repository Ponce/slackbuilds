The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems
acting as IPv6 routers.  It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified 
by RFC 2461, to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a 
node sending a Router Solicitation message.  These messages are required 
for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.

Radvd is dependent upon IPv6 support in the Linux kernel; this comes enabled 
by default with Slackware 14's generic and huge kernels.  To enable IPv6 
support manually, you must set the following entry in your custom kernel's 
.config file and recompile: CONFIG_IPV6=m

Once the slackware package is installed, edit /etc/radvd.conf to reflect 
your current IPv6 configuration. An init script has been provided at 
/etc/rc.d/rc.radvd.  To have this start upon each boot, add the following 
lines to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local file:
	## Start the radvd daemon:
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.radvd ]; then
	   /etc/rc.d/rc.radvd start
	fi

check is an optional (build-time only) dependency.
