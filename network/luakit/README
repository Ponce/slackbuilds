luakit is a fast, light and simple to use micro-browser framework
exensible by Lua using the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+
toolkit.

The configuration options are endless, the entire browser is
constructed by the config files present in /etc/xdg/luakit
Just copy the files you wish to change (and the rc.lua) into
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/luakit (defaults to ~/.config/luakit) and
luakit will use those files when you next launch it.

luajit is an optional dependency. You can pass LUAJIT=1 to the 
SlackBuild.
