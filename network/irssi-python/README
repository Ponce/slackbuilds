irssi-python (Python 2.x scripting support for irssi)

irssi-python embeds Python into an Irssi module, providing most of the
functionality of the Perl wrapper to Python scripts using a similar
interface.

After the package is installed, you can test it from within irssi
by running "/load python". If this works OK, you can configure irssi
to always load the module with a command like:

$ echo 'load python' >> ~/.irssi/startup

Beware of upgrades: if Slackware's irssi or python packages are ever
upgraded, you'll almost certainly have to rebuild & reinstall this.
Symptoms may include irssi ABI version mismatch errors or segfaults.

If you get a warning about an irssi version mismatch when building
irssi-python, first update your irssi package to the latest one in
patches/:

# slackpkg update
# slackpkg upgrade irssi

If you still get the warning, set the environment variable IRSSI_VER
to the correct irssi version. You'll also have to have the irssi source
tarball in the SlackBuild directory. It should be available from:

http://ftp.slackware.com/pub/slackware/slackware-14.2/patches/source/irssi/
