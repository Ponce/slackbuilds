# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

irssi-python: irssi-python (Python2 scripting support for irssi)
irssi-python:
irssi-python: irssi-python embeds Python into an Irssi module, providing most
irssi-python: of the functionality of the Perl wrapper to Python scripts using a
irssi-python: similar interface.
irssi-python: After the package is installed, you can test it from within irssi
irssi-python: by running "/load python". If this works OK, you can configure irssi
irssi-python: to always load the module with a command like:
irssi-python: $ echo 'load python' >> ~/.irssi/startup
irssi-python:
irssi-python: This package was built for irssi-@IRSSI_VER@.
