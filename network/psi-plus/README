Development branch of Psi XMPP client by psi-dev@conference.jabber.ru

Note that this is intended for advanced users and developers.

In 2009 a Psi fork named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are: implementation
of new features, writing of patches and plugins for transferring them to
upstream. As of 2017 the most of active Psi+ developers have become official
Psi developers, but Psi+ still has a number of unique features. From developers
point of view Psi+ is just a development branch of Psi IM client which is
hosted at separate git repositories and for which rolling release development
model is used.

Note that this can coexist with the stable Psi package.
