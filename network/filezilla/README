FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS and
SFTP client with lots of useful features and an intuitive graphical user
interface.

pugixml is an optional dependency - to use an installed version of pugixml,
run the script as "PUGIXML=yes ./filezilla.SlackBuild" - otherwise, the
build will use an included copy of pugixml.
