freenx (Free implementation of the NX Server)

Freenx is an application/thin-client server based on nx technology.
NoMachine nx is the next-generation X compression and roundtrip suppression 
scheme. It can operate remote X11 sessions over 56k modem dialup links or 
anything better.  This package contains a free (GPL) implementation of the 
nxserver component.

Because a nx user with some default settings is needed for the server to 
build, a script, preinstall.sh, is provided to be executed (sh preinstall.sh) 
before running the slackbuild: it's pretty straightforward in his functions, 
have a look at it.

The package installs the default nomachine key to protect the connection.
run "nxsetup --purge --uninstall ; sh preinstall.sh ; nxsetup --install"
to set some custom keys (for additional security).

This requires nx.

You need nxclient, also available at slackbuilds.org, on the connecting
clients.
