freenx (Free implementation of the NX Server)

Freenx is an application/thin-client server based on nx technology.
NoMachine nx is the next-generation X compression and roundtrip suppression 
scheme. It can operate remote X11 sessions over 56k modem dialup links or 
anything better.  This package contains a free (GPL) implementation of the 
nxserver component.

Because a nx user with some default settings is needed for the server to 
build, a script, preinstall.sh, is provided to be executed (sh preinstall.sh) 
before running the slackbuild: it's pretty straightforward in his functions, 
have a look at it.  Also, after installation, you will need to run (as root)
"nxsetup --install" to complete the setup process.

This requires nx.
