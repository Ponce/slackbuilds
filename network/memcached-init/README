Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object
caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding
up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of
arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls,
API calls, or page rendering.

Memcached is simple yet powerful. Its simple design promotes quick
deployment, ease of development, and solves many problems facing
large data caches. Its API is available for most popular languages.

This package extends `memcached' by an init-script and (sane)
configuration file for Slackware.
