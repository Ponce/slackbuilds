The Purple Plugin Pack is a compilation of plugins for the libpurple
family of IM clients.

The Purple Plugin Pack was originally created by
Gary Kramelich and Stu Tomlinson as a way to distribute
their ever growing lists of simple Pidgin plugins.

This includes an optional patch to change the default nickserv identify command
in the irchelp plugin to:

/msg nickserv identify <password>

rather than the '/identify <password>' command that it defaults to, which fails
on some IRCd's such as e.g. ngircd (also available on slackbuilds.org).

To use the patch do:

IDENTIFY_PATCH=1 ./purple-plugin-pack.SlackBuild
