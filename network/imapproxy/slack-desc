# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

imapproxy: imapproxy (SquirrelMail's IMAP Proxy server)
imapproxy:
imapproxy: SquirrelMail's IMAP Proxy is a caching IMAP proxy server intended
imapproxy: for use with webmail clients that cannot maintain persistent
imapproxy: connections to an IMAP server.
imapproxy: IMAP Proxy simply sits between your webmail server and your IMAP
imapproxy: server. It accepts connections from your webmail server for each
imapproxy: client login, then proxies that connection to your real IMAP server.
imapproxy: When your webmail client disconnects, IMAP Proxy will leave the
imapproxy: connection open to the IMAP server such that when your webmail client
imapproxy: reconnects, the existing connection may be re-used.
