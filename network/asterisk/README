Asterisk is an open source framework for building communications
applications. Asterisk turns an ordinary computer into a
communications server. Asterisk powers IP PBX systems, VoIP gateways,
conference servers and other custom solutions. It is used by small
businesses, large businesses, call centers, carriers and government
agencies, worldwide.

Asterisk now includes an internal version of pjsip. As such, pjsip
conflicts with this package and should be removed.

Optional dependencies: alembic, dahdi-complete, jansson, libpri,
                       unixODBC
