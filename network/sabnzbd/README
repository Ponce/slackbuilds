SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

This requires a sabnzbd user and group which can be created like so:
# groupadd -g 296 sabnzbd
# useradd -d /opt/sabnzbd -s /bin/false -u 296 -g 296 sabnzbd

SABnzbd can be started with the script /etc/rc.d/rc.sabnzbd at boot.
It will then run as user sabnzbd. This is intended for server without X usage.
SABnzbd can be configured by pointing your browser to:
http://<hostname>:8080

It can also be started from the application menu/launcher or from the
commandline with 'sabnzbd'. It will then run as the logged in user.
This is intended for desktop usage.
