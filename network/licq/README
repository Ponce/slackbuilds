Licq is an instant messaging client for *nix Systems. It is a full
featured ICQ client, although Jabber support has been added recently
as well. It features a plugin structure that allows for different
front ends, protocols and more.

By default the qt4-gui, console, auto-reply and aosd plugins are
built. This requires libaosd as well as cdk and can be overridden by
setting the PLUGINS environment variable to a space seperated list of
auto-reply, forwarder, osd, rms, aosd, console, jabber, msn, qt4-gui.

Optional dependencies are cdk for the console, libxosd for the osd and
libaosd for the aosd plugin respectivly, all available from
SlackBuilds.org.
