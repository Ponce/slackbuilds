# 20210911 bkw: Update for v20210227.
# 20201102 bkw: Update for v20201014.
# 20191201 bkw: Update for v20190228.

# 20181203 bkw:
# - Update for v20181125.
# - Lua-5.1 (plain lua build) is no longer supported. Add a mess o' logic
#   to autodetect lua52 or lua53, and allow the user to override it.
# - When built with lua support, add lua version number to slack-desc.
# - Allow users to selectively disable unneeded features, see defines.default.

# 20180629 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance.
# - Move binary to /usr/sbin (to match the section 8 man page). But
#   leave compatibility symlink in /usr/bin to avoid breaking everyone's
#   rc.local or other scripts. BUILD=2.
# - Fix a couple of compiler warnings.
# - Add .htpasswd support. It's enabled by default in upstream's BSD-only
#   Makefile.
# - Optional Lua support.
# - Tweak man page, de-NetBSDify the pathnames.
# - Simplify script a bit.

# (*shudder*) pmake. Makefile.boot is a stripped-down generic Makefile
# that does work with GNU make... but it's a bit too stripped down,
# have to add a couple of features that were removed.
