IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility. IPTraf-ng gathers data
like TCP connection packet and byte counts, interface statistics and activity
indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns,and LAN station packet and byte counts.
IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic monitor which shows TCP flag information,
packet and byte counts, ICMP details, OSPF packet types, and oversized IP packet
warnings; interface statistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP and other IP
packet counts, IP checksum errors, interface activity and packet size counts;
a TCP and UDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and outgoing packets for
common TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics module that discovers active
hosts and displays statistics about their activity; TCP, UDP and other protocol
display filters so you can view just the traffic you want; logging; support for
Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and loopback interfaces; and utilization of the
built-in raw socket interface of the Linux kernel, so it can be used on a wide
variety of supported network cards.

iptraf-ng is a fork of the original iptraf.
