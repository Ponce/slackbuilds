# Slackware build script for mitmproxy-bin

# I was gonna package this up from source, but it just has too many
# dependencies, many of which aren't on SBo already. I'd have to add
# at least 15 or 20 python modules, and I just won't. The official
# binary release is "frozen" executables with no external Python
# dependencies (just shared libs that are part of Slackware already).

# This is mostly just a binary repack of the official build. Which
# is only for x86_64 Linux (sorry, 32-bit users).

# I named this with the -bin suffix so that someday someone (other
# than me!) can do a proper build-from-source mitmproxy SlackBuild,
# with tons of dependencies in REQUIRES...

# There's *nothing* in the Linux tarball besides the executables, so
# I've also included some docs from the source tarball, but not the
# complete API docs (again, to avoid a long dependency chain of the
# stuff needed to build them). Use https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/
# for that.

You're about to build a 64-bit (x86_64) package, which will work fine
if you install it on an x86_64 Slackware64 system... but not on *this*

Press Enter or wait 5 seconds to continue. Or, press ^C to abort.
