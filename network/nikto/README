Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs
comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including
over 3500 potentially dangerous files/CGIs, versions on over 900 servers,
and version specific problems on over 250 servers. Scan items and plugins
are frequently updated and can be automatically updated (if desired).

Nikto requires libwhisker2 and Net-SSLeay perl modules, both of which
are available in the SlackBuilds.org repository.

WARNING: if you're updating from 2.03 to 2.1.0 keep in mind that
the configuration file have been changed from the old location
/etc/nikto/config.txt (a debianism I introduced to work around the
config.txt unspecified location) to the newer, official /etc/nikto.conf.
Speaking of debianism: I removed the symolic link /usr/bin/nikto creation,
upgradepkg will not rm it but newer installs will not have it anymore. If
you like the link and want to retain it in future updates, just uncomment
the needed lines inside the SlackBuild.
