fping3 (send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts)

fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts.

NOTE: Old fping and fping6 packages are no longer needed, and should probably
be removed before installing this one.
