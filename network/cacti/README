Cacti is a complete network graphing solution designed to
harness the power of RRDTool's data storage and graphing funcionality.

Cacti provides a fast poller, advanced graph templating, multiple
data acquisition methods, and user-management features out of the box.

All of this is wrapped in an intuitive, easy to use interface that
makes sense for LAN-sized installations up to complex networks with
hundreds of devices.

This SlackBuild uses the following defaults:
* DOCROOT=/var/www/htdocs
* PHPUSER=root
* PHPGROUP=apache

Change these at build time if preferred:
# DOCROOT=/your/preferred/directory \
    PHPUSER=youruser PHPGROUP=yourgroup \
    ./cacti.SlackBuild

httpd, php, and mariadb (as included in Slackware) must also be configured
properly and running.  Check the included documentation to setup your
MariaDB database and users.
