zabbix_agentd is the Linux agent daemon used to monitor Linux boxes
and send the data to the zabbix server.

Zabbix offers advanced monitoring, alerting and visualization features,
including distributed monitoring, auto-discovery, notifications, etcetera.

zabbix_agentd needs to run under its own user/group. This has been assigned
to the following by SlackBuilds.org, but feel free to change it on your
system for consistency with local assignments.
  User:   zabbix            UID: 228        GID: 228
  group:  zabbix                            GID: 228

You can pass alternate values for the user and group using
ZABBIXUSER and ZABBIXGROUP variables when running the build script.

For some important post-build and basic configuration instructions,
see the included README.SLACKWARE file.
