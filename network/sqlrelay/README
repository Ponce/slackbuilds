With SQL Relay, you can speed up and enhance the scalability of database-driven
web-based applications, access databases from unsupported platforms, throttle
database access, distribute load over clustered or replicated databases,
route queries and migrate applications from one database to another.

Two optional dependencies, postgresql and freetds will be auto detected at
build time, they can be found on SlackBuilds.org
