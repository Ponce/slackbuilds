BitlBee is an IRC instant messaging gateway licensed under the terms of the
GPL.  It communicates with the end user via the IRC protocol whilst interacting
with popular chat networks such as AIM, ICQ, MSN, Yahoo, and Jabber. The user's
buddies appear as normal IRC users in a channel, and conversations use the
private message facility of IRC.

After your installation you will need to configure bitlbee. There are two ways 
starting bitlbee: Either as a forked deamon (preferred), or the old way of starting 
it through inetd (mostly deprecated these days).

Bitlbee now includes a standard rc.bitlbee. To have this start on boot-up, add 
the following code to /etc/rc.d/rc.local for example

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.bitlbee ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.bitlbee start
fi

If you choose to use inetd , you need to modify your /etc/inetd.conf so bitlbee will
be started when /etc/rc.d/rc.inetd is called on bootup.  Add the line below to
your /etc/inetd.conf file:
	6667    stream  tcp nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/bitlbee

Restart inetd (/etc/rc.d/rc.inetd restart). All that is left to do now is
connect your irc client to the localhost.

if you want to use libevent for events, instead of the default glib, install 
libevent and run the script like this:  EVENTS=libevent ./bitlbee.SlackBuild

OTR (Off the record) is not compiled by default. If you want bitlbee to 
compile with OTR capabilities, you'll need to install libotr from Slackware
and run the script as follows: OTR=yes ./bitlbee.SlackBuild

NOTE: The default "bot"/bitlbee daemon is called 'root'. This is not the root
user on your system. You can easily change it. Register and identify yourself
first, and then:
	rename root BitlBot
	(or whatever you want)

NOTE: Since bitlbee now runs as a daemon instead of from inetd, bitlbee runs
under its own user (UID/GID: 250). If you have older databases of bitlbee, you 
may want to change the permissions on the files in /var/lib/bitlbee.
