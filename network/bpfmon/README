BPF based visual packet rate monitor.
While tcpdump shows what packets are going through the network,
bpfmon will show how much in terms of bytes per second and packets
per second in a nice pseudo-graphical terminal interface.
bpfmon also supports monitoring an iptables rule that is selected
by command line option or selected from a menu.
