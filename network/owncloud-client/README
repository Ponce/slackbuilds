The ownCloud Sync Client is a desktop program you install on your computer.
You specify one or more directories on the local machine to sync with your
ownCloud server, and always have your latest files wherever you are.  Make
a change to the files on one computer, it will flow across the others using
the desktop sync clients.

This package will build against qt5 libraries if they are present on your
system.  This will cause issue with qtkeychain as it will build against qt4
by default.  One way to work around this is to uninstall qt5 before building
the owncloud-client package.

This package optionally requires the Sphinx package in order to create its
man pages.
