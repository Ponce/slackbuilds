ddgr is a cmdline utility to search DuckDuckGo from the terminal. While googler is
highly popular among cmdline users, in many forums the need of a similar utility for
privacy-aware DuckDuckGo came up. DuckDuckGo Bangs are super-cool too! So here's ddgr
for you!

Unlike the web interface, you can specify the number of search results you would like to
see per page. It's more convenient than skimming through 30-odd search results per page.
The default interface is carefully designed to use minimum space without sacrificing
readability.

ddgr isn't affiliated to DuckDuckGo in any way.
