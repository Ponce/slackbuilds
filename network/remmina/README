Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be
useful for system administrators and travellers, who need to work
with lots of remote computers in front of either large monitors or
tiny netbooks. Remmina supports multiple network protocols in an
integrated and consistant user interface. Currently RDP, VNC, SPICE,
and SSH are supported.

Optional support for extra features can be enabled with some switches:
AVAHI=ON     (Avahi/Zeroconf, requires avahi, default OFF)
KWALLET=ON   (Use KWallet instead of GNOME Keyring, default ON)
TELEPATHY=ON (Telepathy, default OFF)
