The following (somewhat modified) patches from
http://surf.suckless.org/patches/ are included:

searchengines - Allows simple use of various search engines. Each search
engine has a tag. To use, press ctrl+G, then e.g. "g foo bar" to search
google for foo and bar. Supported engines:

  d - duckduckgo.com
  g - google.com
  dict - search for a word on thefreedictionary.com
  sb - search for packages on slackbuilds.org

homepage - The browser will start at your home page if called with no
arguments (normally it starts with a blank window).
