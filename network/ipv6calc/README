ipv6calc is a small utility written in programming language C to
manipulate (not only) IPv6 addresses. Intentions were converting a
given IPv6 address into compressed format, converting a given IPv6
address into the same format like shown in /proc/net/if_inet6 and
(because it was not difficulty) migrating the Perl program ip6_int
into. Now only one utility is needed to do a lot.

This utility was also used in the past to extend features on
network-functions-ipv6 library, used by initscripts-ipv6.

To enable IP2Location support you will need to install C-Ip2location
first, and then pass:

  IP2LOCATION=yes

to this Slackbuild.
