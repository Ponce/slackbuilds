An efficient re-implementation of Electrum Server, 
inspired by ElectrumX, Electrum Personal Server and bitcoincore-indexd.

An init script has been provided to run
electrs as a daemon. To configure electrs, edit:

/etc/electrs/config.toml

!! Before you run the server, specify the daemon directory !!
                   !! And setup permissions !!

Remember to chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs before starting.

In order to use the default configuration you should create a
'electrs' user and group with the following commands:

groupadd -g 386 electrs
useradd -u 386 -g 386 -c "electrs - Electrum Server" \
-M -d /var/run/electrs -s /bin/false electrs

To start electrs automatically at system start, add the following
to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs start
fi

To properly stop electrs on system shutdown, add the following
to: /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.electrs stop
fi
