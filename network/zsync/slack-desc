# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

zsync: zsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from
zsync: a remote web server, where you have a copy of an older version of the
zsync: file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of
zsync: the file. It uses the same algorithm as rsync.
