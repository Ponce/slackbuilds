weechat (IRC client)

WeeChat is a light, fast, multilingual, curses-based multiplatform
IRC client.

WeeChat supports:
- DCC files and chats, multi-server connections, background connections.
- IPv6, SSL, proxy, auto-reconnection, DCC2, nicklist, window splitting.
- FIFO pipe for remote control; Aspell; scripting in Perl, Python 3,
  Ruby, Tcl, Scheme, Lua[1], JavaScript[2], PHP[3]; nick
  auto-completion; lag indication; auto-logging; and client upgrades
  without dropping connections.

WeeChat will be built with support for Perl, Python 3, Guile, Ruby,
and Tcl scripting[1]. Once WeeChat is running, you can install scripts
using the built-in script manager ("/help script" to get started).

[1] To enable Lua scripting, install lua before building this.

[2] JavaScript is not currently supported in this build of WeeChat. It
    also isn't supported in Debian's set of weechat packages, for what
    that's worth.

[3] PHP is not supported in this SlackBuild because Slackware's php
    package isn't built with --enable-embed.
