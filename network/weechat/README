weechat: weechat (IRC client)

WeeChat is a light, fast, multilingual, curses-based multiplatform
IRC client.

WeeChat supports:
- DCC files and chats, multi-server connections, background connections,
- IPv6, SSL, proxy, auto-reconnection, DCC2, nicklist, window splitting,
- FIFO pipe for remote control, Aspell, JavaScript[1], Perl, Python,
  Ruby, nick auto-completion, lag indication, auto-logging and client
  upgrades without dropping connections.

WeeChat will be built with support for Perl, Python, Guile, Ruby,
and Tcl scripting. Once WeeChat is running, you can install scripts
using the built-in script manager ("/help script" to get started).

Optional dependencies: lua53, lua53, or lua. If one or more of
these are installed, Lua scripting support will also be included. The
highest-numbered version of lua will be used, if multiple versions are
installed.

[1] JavaScript is not currently supported in this build of WeeChat. It
also isn't supported in Debian's weechat package, for what that's
worth.
