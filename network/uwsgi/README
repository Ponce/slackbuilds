uWSGI is a fast, self-healing and developer/sysadmin-friendly
application container server coded in pure C.  Born as a WSGI-only
server, over time it has evolved in a complete stack for
networked/clustered web applications, implementing message/object
passing, caching, RPC and process management.  It uses the uwsgi (all
lowercase; included by default in Nginx and Cherokee web servers)
protocol for all the networking/interprocess communications.

uWSGI is designed to be fully modular.  This means that different
plugins can be used in order to add compatibility with tons of different
technology on top of the same core.

This script builds plugins for Python 2.6, Python 3.2 (optional, pass
PYTHON32=yes to enable; requires python3 to be installed), Perl PSGI
(disabled, works only with Perl from -current), and Ruby Rack.
