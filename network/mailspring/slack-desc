# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mailspring: Mailspring is a new version of Nylas Mail maintained by one of the
mailspring: original authors. It's faster, leaner, and shipping today! It replaces
mailspring: the JavaScript sync code in Nylas Mail with a new C++ sync engine
mailspring: based on Mailcore2. It uses roughly half the RAM and CPU of Nylas Mail
mailspring: and idles with almost zero "CPU Wakes", which translates to great
mailspring: battery life. It also has an entirely revamped composer and other
mailspring: great new features.
