guacamole-server contains all the native, server-side components
required by Guacamole to connect to remote desktops.  It provides
a common C library, libguac, which all other native components
depend on, as well as separate libraries for each supported
protocol, and guacd, the heart of Guacamole.

The dependency for the freerdp library is optional as Slackware
by default has libvncserver and libssh2 installed.
