guacamole-server - Guacamole server

guacamole-server contains all the native, server-side components
required by Guacamole to connect to remote desktops.  It provides
a common C library, libguac, which all other native components
depend on, as well as separate libraries for each supported
protocol, and guacd, the heart of Guacamole.

libwebp is an optional dependency.
