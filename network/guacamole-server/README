guacamole-server - Guacamole server

guacamole-server contains all the native, server-side
components required by Guacamole to connect to remote
desktops.  It provides a common C library, libguac, which all
other native components depend on, as well as separate
libraries for each supported protocol, and guacd, the heart
of Guacamole.

The dependency for the libraries of freerdp, libtelnet, libssh2 are
optional, as Slackware by default has libvncserver installed.
