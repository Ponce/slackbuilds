FileZilla Client is a fast and reliable cross-platform FTP, FTPS and
SFTP client with lots of useful features and an intuitive graphical
user interface.

tinyxml is an optional dependency - to use an installed version of
tinyxml, run the script as "TINYXML=yes ./filezilla.SlackBuild"
otherwise, the build will use an included copy of tinyxml.

*NOTE*
this conflicts with the filezilla script: install only one of the two!
