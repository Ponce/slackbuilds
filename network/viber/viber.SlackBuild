# In my opinion, it's a bug... that is, Viber must be called from installation path
# or with complete path to installation path, because it looks for other files.
# Any symbolic link or hard copy of main binary to /usr/bin would yield a
# non-working launcher.
#
# ViberPC is the name of the window (it is better to call it as such for a better
# integration with docks, like cairo-dock)
# Anyway for compatibility with previous version a link to /usr/bin/viber is created.
