Elemental-IRCd is a high performance, lightweight, and scalable IRC daemon. It
is a fork of the now-defunct ShadowIRCD and seeks to continue in the direction
ShadowIRCD was headed.

An `/etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd` script is supplied which supports
start/stop/restart/reload, which you can call from your rc.local:

    # /etc/rc.d/rc.local
    # ==================
    if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.elemental-ircd start
    fi

The `reload` parameter will make an already running ircd reload its
configuration file.

The elemental-ircd will refuse to run as root, so you need to create a user
for it:
    groupadd -g 315 elemental-ircd
    useradd -u 315 -g 315 -d /var/lib/elemental-ircd elemental-ircd
By default we name the user `elemental-ircd` with UID 315, and put it in the
`elemental-ircd` group (GID 315). If you want to give it a different name, uid
or gid, you can give
    IRCD_UNAME=elemental-ircd
    IRCD_UID=315
    IRCD_GID=315
different values when running the slackbuild script.

Before starting the ircd, you'll need to create a configuration file for it.
It should be named `/etc/elemental-ircd/ircd.conf`. In that directory there
is already an `example.conf` and a `reference.conf`.

Note: elemental-ircd comes with a binary called `/usr/bin/mkpasswd`, which is
used to create passwords for o-lines, but it creates a conflict with
`/usr/bin/mkpasswd` from expect, so the `mkpasswd` supplied by elemental-ircd
is renamed to `ircd-mkpasswd` by the SlackBuild script.
