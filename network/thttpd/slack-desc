# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

thttpd: thttpd (the tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server)
thttpd:
thttpd: thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
thttpd: Simple: It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.
thttpd: Well, maybe a little more than the minimum. Small: It has a very
thttpd: small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about
thttpd: memory allocation. Portable: It compiles cleanly on most any
thttpd: Unix-like OS. Fast: In typical use it's about as fast as the best
thttpd: full-featured servers. Secure: It goes to great lengths to protect
thttpd: the web server machine against attacks and breakins from other sites.
