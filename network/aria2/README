aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols
are HTTP(S), FTP, BitTorrent  (DHT, PEX, MSE/PE), and Metalink.

This requires c-ares from SlackBuilds.org.

To use OpenSSL and Expat rather than GnuTLS and libxml2 run the
script as follows:
	XML="libexpat" HTTPS="openssl" ./aria2.SlackBuild
