It's showtime in a terminal near you! Put on your best colours, 
resize to 80 columns, and let your fingers fly!

Termshows are purely text based. This makes them ideal for demoing 
instructions (as the user can copy-paste), making fail-safe 
"live-coding" sessions (plain text is very scalable), and sharing all 
your l33t terminal hacks.
