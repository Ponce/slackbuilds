# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rubygem-showterm: It's showtime in a terminal near you! Put on your best colours,
rubygem-showterm: resize to 80 columns, and let your fingers fly! Termshows are purely
rubygem-showterm: text based. This makes them ideal for demoing instructions (as the
rubygem-showterm: user can copy-paste), making fail-safe "live-coding" sessions (plain
rubygem-showterm: text is very scalable), and sharing all your l33t terminal hacks.
