Bip is an irc proxy with SSL support, which means it keeps connected to
your preferred IRC servers, can store the logs for you, and even send
them back to your IRC client(s) upon connection.  You may want to use
bip to keep your logfiles (in a unique format and on a unique computer)
whatever your client is, when you connect from multiple workstations, or
when you simply want to have a playback of what was said when you were away.
