protonvpn-cli is the official Linux command line tool for connecting to
the ProtonVPN.  It is a full rewrite of the original bash protonvpn-cli
in Python, which adds more features and functionality with the purpose
of improving readability, speed, and reliability.

Before using protonvpn-cli, it must be initialized. Run (as root)

  protonvpn init

and follow the prompts on the screen. Your OpenVPN username and password
can be found at https://account.protonvpn.com/account. Note that both
free and paid accounts are supported.

After protonvpn-cli is configured, run (as root)

  protonvpn connect -f

to connect to ProtonVPN using the fastest available server.

Before uninstalling, run

  protonvpn configure

to purge the configuration files.

All dependencies must be built with Python3 support.
