# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

emailrelay: emailrelay (SMTP proxy and store-and-forward MTA)
emailrelay:
emailrelay: E-MailRelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message
emailrelay: transfer agent (MTA). When running as a proxy all e-mail messages
emailrelay: can be passed through a user-defined program, such as a spam
emailrelay: filter, which can drop, re-address or edit messages as they pass
emailrelay: through. When running as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages
emailrelay: are stored in a local spool directory, and then forwarded to the
emailrelay: next SMTP server on request.
