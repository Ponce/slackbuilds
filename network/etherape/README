EtherApe is a graphical network monitor modeled after etherman. Featuring
Ethernet, IP, TCP, FDDI and Token Ring modes, it displays network activity
graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. Color coded
protocols display.

It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It
can filter traffic to be shown, and can read traffic from a file as well
as live from the network.

To set the kdesu su wrapper when called from the GUI desktop pass
KDESU=yes to the SlackBuild. This is not the default option, but if not
enabled etherape will not monitor the ports if not called by root.

EtherApe requires libgnomeui.
