Utility to setup mountable SFTP and WebDAV connections.

Includes a GUI tool written in PyQt4 and command line tools as follows:

 - add-sftp-connector      : sets up a mountable SFTP (sshfs) connection
 - remove-sftp-connector   : removes a mountable SFTP (sshfs) connection
 - add-webdav-connector    : sets up a mountable webdav (davfs2) connection
 - remove-webdav-connector : removes a mountable webdav (davfs2) connection

Either one of the dependencies (davfs2, sshfs-fuse) can be left out, if you choose not to use that connection type.
