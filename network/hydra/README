Hydra (A very fast network login cracker)

One of the biggest security holes are user passwords, as every
password security study shows. This tool is a proof of concept,
to give researchers and security consultants a way to demonstrate
how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a remote system.
           THIS TOOL IS FOR LEGAL PURPOSES ONLY!

postgresql is an optional dependency, as is sap, but sap is not available
at SBo.

This SlackBuild includes an option to omit the GTK-based frontend xhydra.
To omit xhydra, just pass XHYDRA=0 to the script:
    XHYDRA=0 sh hydra.SlackBuild
