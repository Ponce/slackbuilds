lighttpd2 is a fast, secure, and flexible webserver. It is optimized
for high-performance environments, and provides an extensive feature 
set, including FastCGI, CGI, Auth, output compression, and URL
rewriting support.
this version currently is a work in progress: it's not ready for
production: only for interested people.

By default, this package uses the "lighttpd" user and group to run
lighttpd as a unpriviliged process. The script will exit if these
do not exist on this machine.  We recommend using the following
UID and GID as they do not conflict with any stock Slackware users
and groups, nor with any added by other SlackBuilds.org scripts.
	User:	lighttpd	UID: 208	GID: 208
	Group:	lighttpd			GID: 208

Be sure to see README.SLACKWARE (in this directory, and also installed
with the package documentation) for configuration and setup
information.
