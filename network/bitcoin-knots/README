bitcoin-knots (P2P electronic cash system)

Bitcoin Knots is a specialized version of Bitcoin Core,
modified and maintained by Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer.
It serves as an alternative client software for the Bitcoin network,
offering additional features and enhancements not found in the
standard Bitcoin Core release. Designed to provide advanced users
with more detailed transaction management tools and improved security
measures, Bitcoin Knots is fully compatible with the Bitcoin network,
allowing seamless interaction with nodes running Bitcoin Core.

********************** A few words of Caution **********************
Due to some of the files having same names and installed in the same
places, Bitcoin Knots & Bitcoin Core interfere with each other.

Also, While Bitcoin Knots will build and run on 32bit systems,
it will not run at an efficient level.
Therefore, 64bit is highly recomended as the optimal system.
