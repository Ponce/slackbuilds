nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

    NGINXUSER=backup NGINXGROUP=backup ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to make
sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

Geoip support is now available as an option using the GeopIP package. If you wish
to enable GeoIP the pass GEOIP variable to the slackbuild:

    GEOIP=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild

libatomic support is now available as an option using the libatomic_ops package. If
you wish to enable libatomic then pass LIBATOMIC variable to the slackbuild:

    LIBATOMIC=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild

Extra modules not included with stock nginx can be added by passing them as a
variable to the slackbuild as a space separated list of full paths to modules.
List of extra 3rd party modules available at http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules.

    ADDMODULE="/tmp/passenger-release-5.0.13/ext/nginx" ./nginx.SlackBuild
