nginx [engine x] is a high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy
as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.

By default, nginx will use the "nobody" user and group accounts. You may
specify alternate values on the command line if desired; for example:

  NGINXUSER=apache NGINXGROUP=apache ./nginx.SlackBuild

Regardless of which user and group you decide to use, you will need to
make sure they exist on both the build system and the target system.

Geoip support is now available as an option using the GeopIP
package. If you wish to enable GeoIP the pass GEOIP variable to the
slackbuild:

  GEOIP=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild

Support for gperftools is available as an option using the gperftools
package. If you wish to enable gperftools pass the GPERF variable to
the slackbuild:

  GPERF=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild

Extra modules not included with stock nginx can be added by passing
them as a variable to the slackbuild as a space separated list of
full paths to modules.  List of extra 3rd party modules available at
http://wiki.nginx.org/3rdPartyModules.

  ADDMODULE="/tmp/passenger-release-5.0.13/ext/nginx" ./nginx.SlackBuild

The optional dynamic loadable module support can be activated by setting
NGINX_DYNAMIC. The built modules are disabled by default, uncomment the
needed modules in /etc/nginx/modules.conf. Understand that the module
order in the configuration file is significant, so you may need to
reorder some lines, otherwise you'll get an error about undefined
symbols.

  NGINX_DYNAMIC=yes ./nginx.SlackBuild
