UUDeview is a program that helps you transmit and receive binary files over
the Internet, using electronic mail or newsgroups The UUDeview package
includes both an encoder and a decoder. The decoder automatically detects
the type of encoding used, offering MIME's Base64 and BinHex as well as the
popular uuencoding and the less frequently used xxencoding methods.
Recently, support for the popular yEnc encoding was also added. The encoder
runs the other way around and encodes a binary file for sending it by mail
or news.
