Miredo is an opensource Teredo IPv6 tunneling software for Linux
and BSD operating systems. It includes functional implementations
of all components of the Teredo specification (client, relay and
server). It is meant to provide IPv6 connectivity even from
behind NAT devices.

This script requires a 'miredo' user/group to exist before running.
The recommended UID/GID is 255. You can create these like so:
  groupadd -g 255 miredo
  useradd -u 255 -g 255 -c "Teredo IPv6 Tunneling" -d /dev/null -s /bin/false miredo

Alternatively, you can fall back to default 'nobody' user by passing
NOBODY=yes to the script. However, this is less safe.

The following can be used to start/stop miredo automatically:
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.miredo ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.miredo start
  fi

/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.miredo ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.miredo stop
  fi
