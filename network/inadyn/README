In-a-dyn is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client with HTTPS support.
It is commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used in off-the-shelf
routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of keeping your DNS record
up to date with any IP address changes from your ISP. It can also be used in
installations with redundant (backup) connections to the Internet.
