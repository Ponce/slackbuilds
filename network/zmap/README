ZMap is a fast network scanner designed for Internet-wide network
surveys. On a typical desktop computer with a gigabit Ethernet
connection, ZMap is capable scanning the entire public IPv4 address
space in under five minutes.

ZMap can be used to study protocol adoption over time, monitor service availability
and help us better understand large systems distributed across the Internet.

WARNING: While ZMap is a powerful tool for researchers, please keep in mind that
by running ZMap, you are potentially scanning the ENTIRE IPv4 address space
and some users may not appreciate your scanning.
We encourage ZMap users to respect requests to stop scanning and to exclude
these networks from ongoing scanning.
