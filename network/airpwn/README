Airpwn is a framework for 802.11 (wireless) packet injection.
Airpwn listens to incoming wireless packets, and if the data
matches a pattern specified in the config files, custom content
is injected "spoofed" from the wireless access point. From the
perspective of the wireless client, airpwn becomes the server.

This package also installs lorcon (Loss Of Radio CONnectivity).
