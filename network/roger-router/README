Groupname and Username

You must have the group 'fax' to run this script, for example:

  groupadd -g 273 fax

In order to enable fax transfers, your user must be a member of the
'fax' group.  Use

  gpasswd -a <username> fax

as the root user to add the user <username> to the group fax,
and then log out and log in again as <username>.  (Replace <username>
with the real user name on your system.)
