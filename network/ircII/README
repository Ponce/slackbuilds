ircII (IRC Client, Second Edition)

ircII is a full screen, curses-based interface to Internet Relay
Chat. It gives full access to all of the normal IRC functions, plus a
variety of additional options.

ircII is the oldest IRC client still maintained.

ircII has extensive built-in help, accessed by the /help command. If
you'd rather read the help in a browser, it's also available as:

file:///usr/doc/ircII-20210616_2/html/index.html

By default, this SlackBuild sets the default IRC server to
"SSLIRC/chat.freenode.org:6697". This only applies with ircII is
run without a server argument on the command line. You can change
the default server by setting the DEFSRV environment variable to the
host:port (with optional SSLIRC/ prefix for a secure connection), or
compile without a default server with DEFSRV=none.

Optionally, ircII can be compiled with 'paranoid mode'. This stops
ircII from including the ircII version or realname/username in CTCP
VERSION and FINGER responses. It also stops ircII from responding to
channel-wide CTCP requests entirely. To do this, export PARANOID=yes
in the script's environment.
