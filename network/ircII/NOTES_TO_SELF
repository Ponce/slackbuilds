Notes to self:

wserv and ircio are executed correctly (in the new libexec/ircII dir),
tested them with the following results:

wserv seems to work fine, in the brief bit of testing I did
with it (/window create and related commands).

ircio (the -S option) doesn't work with libera.chat: with SSL
it fails to connect at all, and without SSL it connects but the
server closes the connection before (or during?) sending the
MOTD. I thought it might be due to the 4K buffer size in ircio,
but the MOTD on libera is a lot shorter than that.

I haven't tried other IRC nets with -S, because I don't actually think
anyone cares about it (other ircII forked clients like BitchX and Epic
never even included it).

The help and support scripts are installed in /usr/share/irc. I
thought about changing this to /usr/share/ircII, but don't really see
the point.

Compiling with -Wall, we get:

/tmp/SBo/ircii/source/hook.c:292:40: warning: ‘%3.3u’ directive
output may be truncated writing between 3 and 10 bytes into a region
of size 4 [-Wformat-truncation=]

On further investigation, it's a bogus warning: yes, 3.3%u could
produce up to 10 digits... but before line 292, there's code that
rejects any number above 999. This means sprintf will write 3 bytes of
digits followed by the terminating \0.

We compile with ncurses, not termcap... but the code in term.c uses
termcap functions. These are actually provided by ncurses doing
termcap emulation. See curs_termcap(3x). In practice this works fine,
and lets us use terminals like rxvt-unicode, for which terminfo
entries exist but are too new to be included in crusty old termcap.
