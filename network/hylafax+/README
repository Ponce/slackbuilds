HylaFAX is an enterprise-class system for sending and receiving
facsimiles as well as for sending alpha-numeric pages.  The software
is designed around a client-server architecture.  Fax modems may
reside on a single machine on a network and clients can submit
an outbound job from any other machine on the network.

HylaFAX+ is a more feature rich fork of the HylaFAX project.

See /usr/doc/hylafax-5.5.7/README.SLACKWARE for configuration hints.
