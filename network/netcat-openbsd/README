Netcat is a featured networking utility which reads and writes data across 
network connections, using the TCP/IP protocol.

It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be used directly
or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time, it is a
feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create
almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting
built-in capabilities.

This package contains the OpenBSD rewrite of netcat, including support 
for IPv6, proxies, and Unix sockets.  The installed binary is named
"nc.openbsd" and the manpage is as well.

BTW, this package conflicts with the netcat in slackware as it creates
a symbolic link /usr/bin/nc (to let libvirt stuff work correctly), so
remove netcat (nc) from your system before building/installing this.
