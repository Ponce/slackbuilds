Xinetd is a powerful inetd replacement.  Xinetd has access control mechanisms,
extensive logging capabilities, the ability to make services available based
on time, can place limits on the number of servers that can be started,
and has a configurable defence mechanisms to protect against port scanners,
among other things.

Before starting xinetd, you may wish to switch inetd off if it is running.
To do this:

Do a "ps x" as root and look up the pid of inetd. Then do "kill <pid of inetd>"

Stop inetd from starting at boot:  chmod 0644 /etc/rc.d/rc.inetd
Start xinetd on boot by adding the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ ! -x /etc/rc.d/rc.inetd ] &&  [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.xinetd ]; then 
    /etc/rc.d/rc.xinetd start
  fi
Ensure that /etc/rc.d/{rc.local,rc.xinetd} have executable permissions.

Alternatively, you can avoid all of the edits to rc.local:
mv /etc/rc.d/rc.xinetd /etc/rc.d/rc.inetd
