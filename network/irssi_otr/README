irssi_otr (OTR plugin for irssi)

Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) plugin for the irssi IRC client

To use OTR within irssi, install this package, then "/load libotr"
and "/otr help" for usage instructions. Also see the README in
/usr/doc/irssi_otr-$VERSION.

irssi_otr formerly had support for xchat, but it was removed by
upstream. Be aware of this when upgrading.
