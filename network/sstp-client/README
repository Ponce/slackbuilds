SSTP-Client (SSTP client for Linux)

SSTP is Microsofts Remote Access Solution (RAS) for PPP over SSL. It can be
used instead of PPTP or L2TP, and is only available with Windows Vista/7
connecting to a Windows 2008 Server. The advantage of SSTP compared to PPTP
and L2TP is that it cannot be easily blocked by firewalls since the traffic
is transmitted over HTTPS on port 443. Windows Vista/7 uses SSTP if PPTP or
L2TP cannot be established.

SSTP-Client is an SSTP client for Linux. It can be used to establish a SSTP
connection to a Windows 2008 Server. This software is similar commandline
and configuration as the pptp-client software.

SSTP-Client features:

  Connect to Microsoft RAS network using SSTP
  Use HTTPS with strong encryption over port 443
  Asynchronous HDLC frame support
  Integration with pon/poff with various distributions
