Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt
is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.

Optional dependencies:

* lua53 or lua52 - Powerful, fast, light-weight, embeddable scripting
  language
* notmuch - fast mail indexer for maildir
* kyotocabinet - straightforward implementation of DBM
* libidn2 - GNU IDN Library version 2

This script builds neomutt without optional support
for idn2, notmuch, lua and kyotocabinet.
You can be enabled with:
