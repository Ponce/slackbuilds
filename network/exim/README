Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) used on Unix-like operating systems.
It is freely available under the GNU GPL and it aims to be a general and
flexible mailer with extensive facilities for checking incoming e-mail and
can be integrated with other email tools such as Clamav, Spamassassin,
Bogofilter, and others available at Slackbuilds.org.

Exim was orginally written by Philip Hazel for use in the University of
Cambridge Computing Services e-mail systems.
