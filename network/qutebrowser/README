qutebrowser (qt5 keyboard driven webbrowser)

qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal
GUI. It's based on Python and PyQt5 and free software,
licensed under the GPL.  It was inspired by other
browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

Optional dependency:

qt5-webkit (for the webkit backend)

NOTE:

pyPEG2 needs building for python3:

PYTHON3=yes ./pyPEG2.SlackBuild

If you are using sbopkg you can add this as an option on
their pages before starting the build queue.
