Qutebrowser (qt5 keyboard driven web browser)

Qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal
GUI. It's based on Python and PyQt5 and free software,
licensed under the GPL.  It was inspired by other
browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:

qt5-webkit (for the webkit backend)
Pygments   (for the :view-source command with the QtWebKit backend.
            and with QtWebEngine for ":view-source --pygments")

ADBLOCK NOTE:

If the Python `adblock' library is available, it is now used to
integrate Brave's Rust adblocker library for improved adblocking based
on ABP-like filter lists (such as EasyList).  If it is unavailable,
Qutebrowser falls back to host-blocking.

There are 36 rust requirements for python-adblock, and they aren't
available on SBo yet, so the easiest way to install it is with pip3,
which requires a working network connection.

Instructions to install it into ~/.local/lib with pip3:

1. Update llvm to the package in extra/

To update with slackpkg:

Edit /etc/slackpkg/slackpkg.conf and change the order of PRIORITY so
that `extra' is before `%PKGMAIN' in the list:

  PRIORITY=( extra patches %PKGMAIN pasture testing )

Run `slackpkg upgrade llvm'

Reset PRIORITY back to the default order.  The pip3 commands should be
run as your normal user:

2. Update pip3 to the latest version: pip3 install --user --upgrade pip

3. Install adblock: pip3 install --user adblock

Now start Qutebrowser and check `:version;'.  It should list adblock
with the version number, e.g.:

adblock: 0.4.2

Next, run the update command:

:adblock-update

To see what options there are:

:set content.blocking<TAB>

llvm can be added to /etc/slackpkg/blacklist to keep this version, or
run the slackpkg command again to revert back to the stock version.
