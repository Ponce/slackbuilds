scrcpy is a tool that allows to display and control an Android device
connected on USB (or over TCP/IP). It does not require any root access.

scrcpy requires adb as runtime dependency. adb is part of the package
android-tools on slackbuilds.org .

scrcpy requires the Android device to be switched to Developer Mode
and have a few options switched on (tested on a Redmi 9C NFC phone):

- USB debugging

On some devices it also requires:

- USB debugging (Security settings)

See https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#requirements for additional
details.

This SlackBuild uses the prebuilt server instead of compiling it from
source, to minimize dependencies.

Note: the SlackBuild was tested on Slackware64-14.2 only
