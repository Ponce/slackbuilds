# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tcpflow: tcpflow (data capture)
tcpflow:
tcpflow: tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
tcpflow: connections (flows) and stores the data in a way that is convenient
tcpflow: for protocol analysis and debugging.  Each TCP flow is stored in its 
tcpflow: own file.  Thus, the typical TCP flow will be stored in two files
tcpflow: one for each direction.  tcpflow can also process stored tcpdump 
tcpflow: packet flows.
