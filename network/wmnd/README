wmnd (WindowMaker Network Devices DockApp)

WMND is a dockapp for monitoring network interfaces under WindowMaker
and other compatible window managers. WMND currently works on Linux,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, OpenSolaris, Darwin and IRIX.

WMND can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time, sports several
display modes and can also monitor remote interfaces through SNMP.

An optional dep is "Trend" (not on SBo) which can be used to zoom in on
the bars inside the dockapp.

Note: This dockapp uses a config file "~/.wmndrc". If it's not found,
an empty one is created. You can see an example of how to customize it
in: /usr/doc/wmnd-0.4.18/examples/wmndrc
