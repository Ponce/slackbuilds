WMND is a dockapp for monitoring network interfaces under WindowMaker and other compatible window
managers. WMND currently works on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, OpenSolaris, Darwin and IRIX.

WMND can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time, sports several display modes and can also monitor
remote interfaces through SNMP.

An optional dep is "Trend" (not on SBo) which can be used to zoom in on the bars inside the DockApp.

Note: This dockapp has an automatically generated RC file in the home folder. You can see an example of
how to customize it in the /usr/doc folder.
