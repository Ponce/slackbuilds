# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

slimjet: Slimjet is built on top of the Chromium open-source project. It

slimjet: engine as Google Chrome. However, many additional features and options
slimjet: have been added in Slimjet to make it more powerful, intelligent and
slimjet: customizable than Chrome. In addition to that, Slimjet DOES NOT send
slimjet: any usage statistics back to Google's server like Google Chrome.
