slimjet (Chromium based web browser)

Slimjet is built on top of the Chromium open-source project on which
Google Chrome is also based. It enjoys the same speed and reliablity
provided by the underlying blink engine as Google Chrome. However, many
additional features and options have been added in Slimjet to make it
more powerful, intelligent and customizable than Chrome. In addition to
that, Slimjet DOES NOT send any usage statistics back to Google's server
like Google Chrome, which is a growing concern for many Chrome users due
to the ubiquitous presence and reach of the advertising empire.

Slimjet is compatible with all extensions and plugins designed for
Google Chrome available from the Chrome web store.

This SlackBuild does NOT attempt to compile slimjet from source, it
only repackages the binaries that are provided by the developers.

The MD5SUM and VERSION numbers may be incorrect from time to time due
to the developers' release scheme. If this occurs, you will have the
latest release, but it will be numbered wrongly.

NOTE: Run the wrapper script "flashpeak-slimjet" from the terminal for
the first time to enable the sand box (admin access required). After
that, you can run the wrapper script from a desktop shortcut.
