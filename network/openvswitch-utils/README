Open vSwitch is a multilayer software switch licensed under the open
source Apache 2 license. The goal is to implement a production quality
switch platform that supports standard management interfaces and opens the
forwarding functions to programmatic extension and control.

Open vSwitch is well suited to function as a virtual switch in VM
environments. In addition to exposing standard control and visibility
interfaces to the virtual networking layer, it was designed to support
distribution across multiple physical servers. Open vSwitch supports
multiple Linux-based virtualization technologies including Xen/XenServer,
KVM, and VirtualBox.

Note: This package builds only the Open vSwitch userspace utilities, and
it is incompatible with 'openvswitch' package found on SlackBuilds.org
website. The stock Slackware kernel has been shipping Open vSwitch support
for a while now, and these utilities take this advantage into account
while providing a different approach to Open vSwitch management.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
