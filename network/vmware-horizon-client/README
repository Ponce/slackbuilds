The VMware Horizon Client for Linux, allowing you to use your Slackware box as a
thin client and lets you connect to your company's Virtual Desktop
Infrastructure using the proprietary VMware View 6 PCoIP protocol.

*ATTENTION*: This build script installs binary, proprietary software. Only use
it if you need the proprietary parts and you are ok with installing and using
proprietary software. By installing this SlackBuild you agree to the EULA you'll
find installed in /usr/doc/vmware-horizon-client-4.3.0/. If you do not agree,
uninstall the package.

This SlackBuild installs multiple components. At the moment only the PCoIP and
the Smart Card component seem to work. USB redirection and Virtual Printing
won't work. 

To deactivate one of the working components, use the installation options

PCOIP="NO"

and 

SMARTCRD="NO"

You could try to activate USB support by setting USB="YES". But there will be a
problem with libcrypto. If you find a fix, please email me.

This application is a 32bit application. It won't work on a Slackware64 system
without multilib capability. But it has been tested and works with a multilib
setup.
