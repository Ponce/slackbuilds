management of the Transmission BitTorrent client using its RPC
interface.

 * Remotely add (file/url), start, stop, remove, remove & delete,
   verify, reannounce torrents.
 * Works as a .torrent handler (eg. from a web browser).
 * Set torrent properties such as speed, seed, peer limits, file
   priorities, add/edit/remove trackers.
 * Change remote settings like global limits, download directory, and
   connectivity preferences.
 * UI translations for many languages.

Optional dependencies, detected at compile time:

GeoIP - used to display country flags next to IP addresses.

If you want to build without libnotify (desktop notifications) and
libappindicator (systray) support, set NOTIFY=no in the script's
environment.
