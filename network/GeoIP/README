GeoIP is the proprietary technology that drives MaxMind's IP
geolocation data and services. GeoIP provides businesses with a
non-invasive way to determine geographical and other information
about their Internet visitors in real-time.

This SlackBuild packages a recent full set of GeoLite data files
(Creative Commons licensed), totalling 56Mb uncompressed.

To keep the data files up-to-date, see the geoipupdate SlackBuild.

If you don't want the full set of data files, you have three choices:

(1) You can download only the data files you want before running the
SlackBuild.

(2) You can remove the data files you don't want from the directory
/var/lib/GeoIP after installation.

(3) You can run the SlackBuild with the option 'MINIDATA=yes'. Only the
ipv4 (and optionally ipv6) country data will be packaged.

  MINIDATA=yes ./GeoIP.SlackBuild
