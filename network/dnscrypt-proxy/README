dnscrypt-proxy is a tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS
resolver. It provides a local service which can be used directly as your local
resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests using the
DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.

By default dnscrypt-proxy is configured to use a random DNS server; you will
definitely want to change this.

Note that google-go-lang is a compile-time dependency and is not needed during
run-time.

Be sure to read README.Slackware for information on configuring/running
dnscrypt-proxy as a daemon!
