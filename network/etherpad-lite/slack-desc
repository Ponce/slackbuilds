# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

etherpad-lite: Etherpad lite (really-real time collaborative editor)
etherpad-lite:
etherpad-lite: Etherpad lite is a really-real time collaborative editor spawned
etherpad-lite: from the Hell fire of Etherpad. We're reusing the well tested
etherpad-lite: Etherpad easysync library to make it really realtime. Etherpad Lite
etherpad-lite: is based on node.js ergo is much lighter and more stable than the
etherpad-lite: original Etherpad. Our hope is that this will encourage more users
etherpad-lite: to use and install a realtime collaborative editor. A smaller,
etherpad-lite: manageable and well documented codebase makes it easier for
etherpad-lite: developers to improve the code and contribute towards the project.
