Vidalia is a GUI for the Tor software. Using Vidalia, you can start
and stop the Tor software, view its status at a glance, and monitor
bandwidth usage.  Vidalia also makes it easy to contribute to the Tor
network by helping you set up and manage your own relay.

See README.SBo (which is also installed with the package docs) for some
configuration hints, and how to make use of MaxMind's GeoIP database.

If you don't plan to use MaxMind's GeoIP database, pass GEOIP=no to
the script.

Vidalia requires tor (and GeoIP).
