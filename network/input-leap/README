Slackbuild for Input Leap

Tested on Slackware64-current (15.0) 2024

Input Leap is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers by physically turning a dial on the box to switch the machine you're controlling at any given moment. Input Leap does this in software, allowing you to tell it which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.

At the moment, Input Leap is not compatible with Synergy.

Input Leap needs to be installed on all machines that will share keyboard and mouse.
What's different?

Whereas Synergy has moved beyond its goals from the 1.x era, Input Leap aims to maintain that simplicity. Input Leap will let you use your keyboard and mouse from one computer to control one or more other computers.

Clipboard sharing is supported.

That's it.
