input-leap: Input Leap is software that mimics the functionality 
input-leap: of a KVM switch, which historically would allow you to 
input-leap: use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple 
input-leap: computers by physically turning a dial on the box to 
input-leap: switch the machine you're controlling at any given moment. 
input-leap: Input Leap does this in software, allowing you to tell it 
input-leap: which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the 
input-leap: screen, or by using a keypress to switch focus to a different system.
