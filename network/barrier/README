Barrier (Synergy Fork)

Barrier is KVM software forked from Symless's synergy 1.9 codebase. 
Synergy was a commercialized reimplementation of the original 
CosmoSynergy written by Chris Schoeneman. Whereas synergy has moved 
beyond its goals from the 1.x era, Barrier aims to maintain that 
simplicity. Barrier will let you use your keyboard and mouse from 
machine A to control machine B (or more). It's that simple.
