# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mrtg:
mrtg: MRTG monitors the traffic load on network links such as routers and
mrtg: interfaces. It supports SNMP and generates HTML pages with PNG images
mrtg: showing how much traffic has passed through each interface. MRTG can
mrtg: also be used to graph everything else like disk space, temperatures,
mrtg: and so on.
