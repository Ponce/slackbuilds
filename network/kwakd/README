Kwakd is a very small foot print web server written in C
that serves blank html pages for any request. The request
can be arbitrary, may even be invalid, but only its first
line will be read and the response will be the same: a blank
page consisting of "<html> </html>". It is quite easy to
change the response to whatever you like though. Kwakd can
be handy if you want to intercept traffic from your client
(web browser for example) to annoying sites and direct all
such traffic to your local machine.

By default kwakd uses port 8000, but this can be changed in
the provided initscript by changing the port option.
See /etc/rd.c/rc.kwakd
