# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

kwakd: kwakd (web server)
kwakd:
kwakd: Kwakd is a very small foot print web server written in C that serves
kwakd: blank html pages for any request. The request can be arbitrary, may
kwakd: even be invalid, but only its first line will be read and the 
kwakd: response will be the same: blank page consisting of "<html> </html>".
kwakd: It is quite easy to change the response to whatever you like though.
kwakd: Kwakd can be handy if you want to intercept traffic from your client
kwakd: (web browser for example) to annoying sites and direct all
kwakd: such traffic to your local machine.
