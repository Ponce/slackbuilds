Claws Mail is an email client (and news reader), based on GTK+ featuring:

 * Quick response
 * Graceful, and sophisticated interface
 * Easy configuration, intuitive operation
 * Abundant features
 * Extensibility

The appearance and interface are designed to be familiar to new users
coming from other popular email clients, as well as experienced users.
Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.

The messages are managed in the standard MH format, which features fast
access and data security. You'll be able to import your emails from almost
any other email client, and export them just as easily.

The following plugins will not be built unless these optional dependencies
are found:
  The clamd plugin requires clamav.
  The fancy plugin requires webkitgtk.
  The gdata plugin requires gdata.
