Arora is a simple cross platform web browser whose feature list
includes things like "History" and "Bookmarks". Benjamin Meyer
originally created as a demo for Qt to help test the QtWebKit component
and find API issues and bugs before the release. Arora works on Linux,
OS X, Windows, FreeBSD, and embedded Linux using Qt Embedded and
anywhere Qt does. For more information about the project check out the
Arora Goals wiki page.

Note: This is known to crash if plugins are enabled.
