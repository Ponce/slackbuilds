FDNS

FDNS was designed to run as a local DoH proxy on a Linux desktop, 
or as a server for a small network. Lean and mean, it protects the 
computers against some of the most common cyber threats, all while 
improving the privacy and the system performance.

FDNS is written in C and licensed under GPLv3. The number one job 
is privacy. We use only DoH services from non-logging providers, 
while preferring small operators such as open-source enthusiasts 
and privacy-oriented non-profit organizations.
