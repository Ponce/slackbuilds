Microsoft Edge is a proprietary, cross-platform web browser
created by Microsoft. It was first released in 2015 as part
of Windows 10 and Xbox One and later ported to other
platforms as a fork of Google's Chromium open-source
project: Android and iOS, macOS, older Windows versions
(Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later), and most
recently Linux.
