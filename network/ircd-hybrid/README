ircd-hybrid (A lightweight, high-performance IRC daemon)

ircd is the server (daemon) program for the Internet Relay Chat Program. The
ircd is a server in that its function is to "serve" the client program irc
and other compatible programs with messages and commands. All commands and
user messages are passed directly to the ircd for processing and relaying to
other IRC servers.

This is ircd-hybrid, the highly modified (and hopefully improved) variant of
the original ircd program by Jarkko Oikarinen.

Groupname and Username

You must have the "ircd" group and user to run this script, for example:

  groupadd -g 360 ircd
  useradd -u 360 -s /bin/false -d /var/empty -g ircd ircd
