Quassel IRC with Qt5 support is a modern, cross-platform, distributed
IRC client, meaning that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and
detach from a central core - much like the popular combination of screen
and a text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, but graphical.

This build creates three binaries - quassel, quasselclient, and
quasselcore.

Please see the README.SBo file for a fuller description.
