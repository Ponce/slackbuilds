GNUzilla is the GNU version of the Mozilla suite, and GNU IceCat is
the GNU version of the Firefox browser. Its main advantage is an
ethical one: it is entirely free software. While the Firefox source
code from the Mozilla project is free software, they distribute and
recommend non-free software as plug-ins and addons. Also their
trademark license restricts distribution in several ways incompatible
with freedom 0.

Icecat's additional privacy features are in form of browser addons.
This SlackBuild unbundles them so that users can install the ones they
want in the usual way:

* SpyBlock is a fork of Adblock Plus with extra privacy features.

* Https Everywhere automatically encrypts your communications with
  many major websites, making your browsing more secure.

* HTML5 Video Everywhere enables popular video sites to use the
  browser's built-in video player.

* LibreJS blocks javascript scripts unless they are tagged as free
  software [EXPERIMENTAL]

* AboutIceCat adds a custom "about:icecat" homepage with links to
  information about the free software and privacy features in IceCat,
  and checkboxes to enable and disable the ones more prone to break
  websites. [COSMETIC]
