Dropbox Terms of Service
Posted: January 22, 2015

Thanks for using Dropbox! These terms of service ("Terms") cover your use and
access to the services, client software and websites ("Services") provided by
Dropbox, Inc. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your
information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when
using our Services. By using our Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these
Terms, and to review our Privacy and Acceptable Use policies. If you're using
our Services for an organization, you're agreeing to these Terms on behalf of
that organization.

Your Stuff & Your Permissions
  When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files,
  content, email messages, contacts and so on ("Your Stuff"). Your Stuff is
  yours. These Terms don't give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the
  limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.
  We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up,
  and sharing it when you ask us to. Our Services also provide you with
  features like photo thumbnails, document previews, email organization, easy
  sorting, editing, sharing and searching. These and other features may require
  our systems to access, store and scan Your Stuff. You give us permission to
  do those things, and this permission extends to trusted third parties we work
  with.

Sharing Your Stuff
  Our Services let you share Your Stuff with others, so please think carefully
  about what you share.

Your Responsibilities
  You're responsible for your conduct, Your Stuff and you must comply with our
  Acceptable Use Policy. Content in the Services may be protected by others'
  intellectual property rights. Please don't copy, upload, download or share
  content unless you have the right to do so.
  We may review your conduct and content for compliance with these Terms and
  our Acceptable Use Policy. With that said, we have no obligation to do so. We
  aren't responsible for the content people post and share via the Services.
  Please safeguard your password to the Services, make sure that others don't
  have access to it, and keep your account information current.
  Finally, our Services are not intended for and may not be used by people
  under the age of 13. By using our Services, you are representing to us that
  you're over 13.

Software
  Some of our Services allow you to download client software ("Software") which
  may update automatically. So long as you comply with these Terms, we give you
  a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the
  Software, solely to access the Services. To the extent any component of the
  Software may be offered under an open source license, we'll make that license
  available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override
  some of these Terms. Unless the following restrictions are prohibited by law,
  you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do
  so, or assist anyone in doing so.

Our Stuff
  The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign
  laws. These Terms don't grant you any right, title or interest in the
  Services, others' content in the Services, Dropbox trademarks, logos and
  other brand features. We welcome feedback, but note that we may use comments
  or suggestions without any obligation to you.

Copyright
  We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too. We
  respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the
  law, and such notices should be reported using our DMCA Process. We reserve
  the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and
  terminate accounts of repeat infringers. Our designated agent for notice of
  alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:
    Copyright Agent
    Dropbox, Inc.
    185 Berry Street, Suite 400
    San Francisco, CA 94107
    copyright@dropbox.com

Paid Accounts
  Billing. You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your
  account (turning your account into a "Paid Account"). We'll automatically
  bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic
  renewal until cancellation. You're responsible for all applicable taxes, and
  we'll charge tax when required to do so.
  No Refunds. You may cancel your Dropbox Paid Account at any time but you
  won't be issued a refund unless it's legally required.
  Downgrades. Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or
  terminated under these Terms. If you don't pay for your Paid Account on time,
  we reserve the right to suspend it or reduce your storage to free space
  levels.
  Changes. We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of
  these changes via a message to the email address associated with your
  account.

Dropbox for Business
  Email address. If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address
  provisioned by your employer, your employer may be able to block your use of
  Dropbox until you transition to a Dropbox for Business account or you
  associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.
  Using Dropbox for Business. If you join a Dropbox for Business account, you
  must use it in compliance with your employer's terms and policies. Please
  note that Dropbox for Business accounts are subject to your employer's
  control. Your administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or
  remove information in or from your Dropbox for Business account. They may
  also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox for Business
  account. If you convert an existing Dropbox account into a Dropbox for
  Business account, your administrators may prevent you from later
  disassociating your account from the Dropbox for Business account.

Termination
  You're free to stop using our Services at any time. We also reserve the right
  to suspend or end the Services at any time at our discretion and without
  notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Services if
  you're not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in a manner that
  would cause us legal liability, disrupt the Services or disrupt others' use
  of the Services. Except for Paid Accounts, we reserve the right to terminate
  and delete your account if you haven't accessed our Services for 12
  consecutive months. We'll of course provide you with notice via the email
  address associated with your account before we do so.

Services "AS IS"
  We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we
  can't guarantee. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS
  AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." WE ALSO
  DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
  AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Some states don't allow the disclaimers in this
  paragraph, so they may not apply to you.

Limitation of Liability
  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DROPBOX, ITS
  AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT,
  SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOSS
  OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR
  NOT DROPBOX HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A
  REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; (B) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS
  RELATING TO THE SERVICES MORE THAN THE GREATER OF $20 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY
  YOU TO DROPBOX FOR THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF THE SERVICES IN QUESTION. Some
  states don't allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may
  not apply to you.

Resolving Disputes
  Let's Try To Sort Things Out First. We want to address your concerns without
  needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree
  to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting
  dispute-notice@dropbox.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by
  contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of
  submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.
  We Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims
  relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding
  arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate
  below.
  Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate. You can decline this agreement to
  arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of
  first accepting these Terms.
  Arbitration Procedures. The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will
  administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the
  Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will
  be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco
  (CA), or any other location we agree to.
  Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The AAA rules will govern payment of all
  arbitration fees. Dropbox will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than
  $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any
  offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the
  award. Dropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration
  unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
  Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either you or Dropbox may assert
  claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any
  United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit
  solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the
  Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark,
  trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in
  arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
  No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual
  basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a
  class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class
  actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other
  arbitrations aren't allowed.
  Judicial forum for disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is
  found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Dropbox agree that any
  judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the
  federal or state courts of San Francisco County (CA). Both you and Dropbox
  consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.

Controlling Law
  These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of
  laws principles.

Entire Agreement
  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with
  respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any
  other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable
  to the subject matter of these Terms. These Terms create no third party
  beneficiary rights.

Waiver, Severability & Assignment
  Dropbox's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do
  so later. If a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of
  the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be
  substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign
  any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.
  Dropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to
  any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.

Modifications
  We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most
  current version on our website. If a revision meaningfully reduces your
  rights, we will notify you (by, for example, sending a message to the email
  address associated with your account, posting on our blog or on this page).
  By continuing to use or access the Services after the revisions come into
  effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms
