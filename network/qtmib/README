qtmib (graphical SNMP MIB Browser)

qtmib is an easy-to-use SNMP MIB Browser based on the Qt library. It
is a front-end for net-snmp, and it allows the user to query any
SNMP-enabled device. It implements SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c, and it is
released under the GPLv2 license.

qtmib supports a large number of MIBs out of the box. It currently
tracks the netdisco MIB archive. You can also install private MIBs by
dropping them in the ~/.config/qtmib/mibs directory.
