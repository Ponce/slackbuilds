WireGuard is a VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. It is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

This script only builds the WireGuard kernel module.  Userspace
tools are also required to configure and use WireGuard tunnels. Refer
to the wireguard-tools script on SlackBuilds.

NOTE: Slackware-current contains the WireGuard module as of
kernel 5.10.1. If running an up to date -current, installing this
module is no longer required. You will most likely still want to
install the wireguard-tools SlackBuilds package.
