greenbone-security-assistant (UI for OpenVAS)

This is the UI the Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS).

###### Known Problems ######

- PDF report generation is broken.  This may get fixed in a future slackbuild.

- The libssh-0.5.4 shipped with Slackware (at the time of this writing) is
  broken. If you need to run "credentialed" scans against targets running
  OpenSSH 6.7 or beyond (including Slackware), you have 2 options:
    1. Enable diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 as a KexAlgorithm in the sshd_config
       of your targets.
    2. Update your libssh to the latest.
  You also may have problems with targets running Dropbear SSH server.  See
  this thread on LinuxQuestions for more information:
    http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=4175533193

- All the daemons run as root.  There's no (working) configuration options
  or documentation to change this behavior.

- There are a number of tests that depend on other software packages that are
  not available as slackbuilds at this time.  Stay tuned.

- If you're running in a VM environment, or on a headless server, then 
  installing haveged is recommended, particularly for step 11 below.

###### Upgrade Notes ######

If you're updating from OpenVAS-7 to OpenVAS-8, please note the following.
(See: http://www.openvas.org/install-source.html if you're unsure which
version you're running.)

Openvas now uses redis as a temporary database while running scans.  You will
need redis installed and running, as well as hiredis.  See step 2 below on
how to configure redis.

Before running openvas-manager, you'll need to migrate the database.  Simply
run:
# openvasmd --migrate

###### Installation Instructions ######

These instructions assume you're familiar with slackbuilds.  If not, please
refer to http://slackbuilds.org/howto/ .

1. Build and install hiredis.

2. Build and install redis.  You need to uncomment the following 2 lines in the
   /etc/redis/redis.conf file:
#unixsocket /tmp/redis.sock
#unixsocketperm 700
   Now start up redis:
# sh /etc/rc.d/rc.redis start

3. Build and install openvas-libraries.

4. Build and install openvas-scanner.

5. You need a Certificate Authority and server certificate. Run the following
   command:
# openvas-mkcert
      
6. You need the NVT's (Network Vulnerability Tests).  Run the following
   command to sync.  In the future, you can do this through the 
   greenbone-security-assistant interface.  This will take a minute or so
   with a blazing fast internet connection. YMMV.
# openvas-nvt-sync

7. Start the openvas-scanner daemon.
# sh /etc/rc.d/rc.openvassd start

8. Build and install openvas-manager.

9. You need client certificates for manager to talk to scanner.  Use the
   following command.
# openvas-mkcert-client -n -i

10. Initialize the manager database.  This will take a while, so be patient.
# openvasmd --rebuild

11. You want encrypted credentials in the DB, so do this now.
# openvasmd --create-credentials-encryption-key
   This may take a while, so it's best to create some entropy by skipping to
   #13-#15 and then coming back, if needed.

12. Create a user.
# openvasmd --create-user=cary
    If you find the assigned password hard to remember, you can change it 
    right now.
# openvasmd --user=cary --new-password=mekmitasdigoat

13. Sync SCAP data.  This will take some time.
# openvas-scapdata-sync

14. Sync CERT data.
# openvas-certdata-sync

15. Update port names.
# wget http://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xml
# openvas-portnames-update service-names-port-numbers.xml
# rm service-names-port-numbers.xml

16. Start the openvas-manager daemon.
# sh /etc/rc.d/rc.openvasmd start

17. Build and install libmicrohttpd.

18. Build and install greenbone-security-assistant.

19. Launch the greenbone-security-assistant.
# sh /etc/rc.d/rc.gsad start

20. Point your browser at https://<YOUR IP OR HOSTNAME>:9392
    You'll get a certificate error, of course (fixing this is left as an 
    excercise for the reader). Log in with your username/password from #10.

21. [Optional] Build and install openvas-cli.  You'll need this if you ever
    want to script tests.

That's it!  If you run into any problems, you can try running the 
openvas-check-setup script found here:
  https://svn.wald.intevation.org/svn/openvas/trunk/tools/openvas-check-setup

If you don't have a web-server running, you can edit the /etc/rc.d/rc.gsad
script to remove the "-p 9392" option, and it will run on port 443.

Please let me know if you run into any problems.  Patches welcome!

Have Fun!
