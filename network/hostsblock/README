Hostsblock is a bash script for Linux designed to take advantage of the
/etc/hosts file to provide system-wide blocking of internet advertisements,
malicious domains, trackers, and other undesirable content. To do so, it
downloads a configurable set of blocklists and processes and their entries into
a singular file.

The SlackBuild assumes that dnsmasq is not available so it will configure
hostsblock to overwrite the current /etc/hosts file. The install script will
backup the current /etc/hosts file to /etc/hostsblock/hosts.head if it does
not already exist.

After uninstalling hostsblock, you should copy hosts.head back to /etc/hosts.

To have hostsblock automatically update /etc/hosts once a week, run:
  ln -sf /usr/sbin/hostsblock /etc/cron.weekly/hostsblock
