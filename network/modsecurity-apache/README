ModSecurity(tm) is an open source, free web application firewall (WAF)
Apache module. WAFs are deployed to establish an external security layer
that increases security, detects and prevents attacks before they reach web
applications. It provides protection from a range of attacks against web
applications and allows for HTTP traffic monitoring and real-time analysis
with little or no changes to existing infrastructure.

You can get started with ModSecurity by adding the following lines to the
appropriate sections of Apache's main configuration file (x86
architecture):

LoadModule security2_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_security2.so
Include /etc/httpd/extra/modsecurity-recommended.conf
