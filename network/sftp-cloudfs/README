This is a SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) interface to OpenStack
Object Storage, providing a service that acts as a proxy between a
SFTP client and a storage service.

The username/password pair used to open the SFTP session is validated
using the authentication service of the files/storage service to get
an authentication token.

The communication between the client and the SFTP daemon is encrypted
all the time, and the SFTP service supports HTTPS communication with
the remote files/storage service.

There's limited SCP support since 0.10.
