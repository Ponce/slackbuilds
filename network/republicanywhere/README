Republic Anywhere is an integrated technology platform that syncs your phone
number to all your devices and allows you to send and receive text messages from
your computer. You need a Republic Wireless account to use this.

Note: during startup, it looks for /var/lib/dbus/machine-id' (note trailing
single quote). I'm not sure if that is a bug, but it will work after copying
/var/lib/dbus/machine-id to /var/lib/dbus/machine-id'. (You will need to escape
the quote in the cp command.)
