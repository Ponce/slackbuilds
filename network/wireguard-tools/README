WireGuard is a VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. It is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

WireGuard userspace tools require WireGuard support in the kernel (or
as a kernel module).  Refer to the wireguard-linux-compat script on
Slackbuilds to build the associated kernel module package.

openresolv is an optional runtime dependency -- you need it if you want
to use to use wg-quick's DNS option.

The wg-quick script needs at least nft 0.7 installed, if using nft.
Slackware 14.2 ships with nftables 0.6.  As such the build script
will patch wg-quick to always fall back to iptables.

If you have nftables 0.7 or newer installed (i.e. you are running
-current or a modified 14.2 installation), you may want to leave
wg-quick unpatched by setting NEW_NFT as follows -:

NEW_NFT=yes ./wireguard-tools.SlackBuild
