SMCRoute (Static Multicast Routing Daemon)

SMCRoute is a daemon and command line tool to manipulate the multicast
routing table in a UNIX kernel. It can be used as an alternative to dynamic
multicast routers like mrouted or pimd in situations where (only) static
multicast routes should be maintained and/or no proper IGMP signaling exists.
