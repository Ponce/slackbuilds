Pale Moon is a fork of pre-Australis Mozilla Firefox aiming to be fast,
efficient and easy to use.

This SlackBuild just installs a binary package provided by the project. It
doesn't attempt to build the browser from source.

You can force Pale Moon to use system-provided hunspell instead of its own
dictionary by passing the USE_SYSTEM_SPELLCHECK=yes variable to the script.

If you need to change the GUI language, please visit
https://www.palemoon.org/langpacks.shtml and follow the installation
instructions.
