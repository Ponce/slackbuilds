mosaic-ck (Cameron Kaiser's fork of NCSA Mosaic)

Mosaic is widely considered the grandfather of the modern web
browser. Developed at NCSA, it was the first Web browser to win
widespread use and acceptance. The last release of Mosaic was in 1997.

mosaic-ck is a fork of Mosaic, with several features that allow it
to work as a basic, no-frills browser on the modern WWW. Think of it
as "lynx with images". There is no support for cookies, SSL, Java,
Javascript, Flash, stylesheets, or frames. Table support is optional
(and doesn't work well). Unicode/UTF-8 is partially supported.
