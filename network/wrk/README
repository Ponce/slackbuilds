wrk (HTTP benchmarking tool)

A modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant load when run 
on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded design with scalable 
event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response 
processing, and custom reporting.

Note: Lua and LuaJIT are not required here; wrk is statically-linked against 
the LuaJIT version bundled in the upstream tarball.
