sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the
process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over
of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many
niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of
switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from
the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing
commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
