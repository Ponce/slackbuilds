Pale Moon is an Open Source, Goanna-based web browser available for Microsoft
Windows and Linux (with other operating systems in development), focusing on
efficiency and ease of use. Make sure to get the most out of your browser!

Pale Moon offers you a browsing experience in a browser completely built from
its own, independently developed source that has been forked off from
Firefox/Mozilla code, with carefully selected features and optimizations to
improve the browser's speed*, resource use, stability and user experience,
while offering full customization and a growing collection of extensions and
themes to make the browser truly your own.

If your processor doesn't support sse2 instructions or you get segfaults try
looking in the SlackBuild for the OPTIMIZE build option (eventually refer
to the palemoon developers for help).

To enable debug information, pass the script the parameter ENABLE_DEBUG=yes
