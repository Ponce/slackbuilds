Citadel is a turnkey open-source solution for email and collaboration.

It contains both the server and a text-mode client. You can build 
an entire working system with this, or you can just build the 
client and connect to some other existing system. It also provides 
connectivity through:

 * SMTP (Port 25 by default)
 * POP3 (Port 110 by default; SSL Enabled on port 995)
 * IMAP (Port 143 by default; SSL Enabled on port 993)
 * Citadel (Port 504; used by dedicated Citadel clients)
 * SMTP-MSA (Port 587; requires SMTP authentication)
 * ManageSieve (Port 2020; edit your mail filtering scripts with 
   your favorite GUI client)
 * Postfix TCP dictionary (if you have an upstream mail hub running 
   Postfix, it can use this service to verify valid email addresses 
   on your Citadel)
 * lmtp.socket (Local mail transport, for use with an external MTA 
   if for some reason you do not wish to use Citadel's built in SMTP 
   service)
 * lmtp-unfiltered.socket (same as above, but without spam filtering)
 * citadel.socket (Citadel protocol)

After installation, run /opt/citadel/setup to configure Citadel.
That script requires a 'citadel' user/group to exist before
running.
The recommended UID/GID is 276. You can create these like so:
  groupadd -g 276 citadel
  useradd -u 276 -g 276 -c "Citadel" -m citadel

It is very easy: just be careful to specify a new user "citadel" 
(or whatever, see above) who will run the server and specify a valid
username and password to log into Citadel.
