Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like
systems, written with security primarily in mind. Dovecot is an excellent choice
for both small and large installations. It's fast, simple to set up, requires no
special administration and it uses very little memory.

This script builds dovecot with support for SSL. As such, you must have openssl
installed - openssl-solibs is not enough in itself to meet this requirement.

This script doesn't add dovecot users and groups, instead it offers sane defaults
that won't conflict with system users and groups, and other scripts from the SBo.

See the documentation in /usr/doc/dovecot-2.2.19/ to get started.
