LOIC - the Low Orbit Ion Cannon

LOIC is an open source network attack application, written in C#. LOIC was
initially developed by Praetox Technologies, but later it was released into the
public domain

LOIC performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack (or when used by multiple
individuals, a DDoS attack) on a target site by flooding the server with TCP
packets, UDP packets, or HTTP requests with the intention of disrupting the
service of a particular host. People have used LOIC to join voluntary botnets.

This SlackBuild simply builds a package from the binaries included in the
source archive. 

mono is needed to run loic:

  mono /opt/loic/LOIC.exe

A handy script /usr/bin/loic and a basic desktop integration file have been
included for ease of use.
