# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

znc:
znc: ZNC will remain connected to an IPv4 or IPv6 IRC server even while you
znc: are offline. You can reattach your client at a later time and catch up
znc: with what happened while you were gone via the history buffer. You can
znc: add additional users under one running process, useful for public
znc: shells that limit background processes. ZNC also supports the dynamic
znc: loading of C++ and Perl modules.
