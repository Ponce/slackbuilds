TeamViewer is a remote control application. TeamViewer provides easy,
fast and secure remote access to Linux, Windows PCs, and Macs.

You must give execute permission on /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd and run
/etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start prior launching TeamViewer application

To make this process repeated on every boot sequence, add this line 
in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.teamviewerd start
fi

NOTE:
1. Newer version of Teamviewer can establish remote control connections
to older version (version 3 and above), but not in the opposite direction.
The same things goes to meetings (version 7 and above).

2. Always stop teamviewerd service before attempting to upgrade as the path
may change on each major release.
