This is the Slackbuild for Powerdns Recursor, a high-performance
recursive resolver.

From the pdns-recursor README:

 The PowerDNS recursor is part of the source tarball of the main
 PowerDNS distribution, but it is released separately. Starting from
 the version 3.0 pre-releases, there are zero known bugs or issues
 with the recursor. It is known to power the resolving needs of over
 100 million internet connections.

Docs are available at http://doc.powerdns.com/built-in-recursor.html

Optional dependencies are protobuf, lua and ragel.
