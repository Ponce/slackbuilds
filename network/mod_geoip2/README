mod_geoip2 is an Apache 2.x module for finding the country and city
that a web request originated from.  It uses the GeoIP library and
database to perform the lookup.  It is free software, licensed under
the Apache license. 

This requires GeoIP.

You will need to add the following line to /etc/httpd/httpd.conf:
  Include /etc/httpd/extra/mod_geoip.conf

mod_geoip2 can be further configured through the Apache configuration file;
see the README in the package's documentation directory for details.
