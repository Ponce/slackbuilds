aMule is a multiplatform ed2k client, fork of the eMule client, using the
wxWidgets class library. It was originally forked from the xMule project,
which in turn was forked from the lMule project. This is turn was the first
fork of eMule to run nativly on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

wxGTK is required for this to build; at least version 2.4.x of wxGTK is
needed, but version 2.6.x is recommended (and this is the version that
is available at SlackBuilds.org).  If you would like to build against
the 2.8.x version, there is a patch included - you'll just need to uncomment
that patch line in the build script.
