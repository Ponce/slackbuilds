OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously send and receive files. 
It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor onion 
service, and generating an unguessable web address so others can download 
files from you, or upload files to you. It does not require setting up 
a separate server or using a third party file-sharing service.

It also requires obfs4proxy (or others e.g. meek) if tor bridge is used.

It has templates of torrc which can be found in /usr/share/onionshare/.
