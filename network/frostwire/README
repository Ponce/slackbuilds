Frostwire is a cross-platform, open-source peer-to-peer filesharing client 
for the Gnutella and BitTorrent protocols.  It is written in Java and is a 
fork of Limewire that includes all of the free LimeWire version's 
functionality, plus a few features of LimeWire Pro's fee based upgrades.  
FrostWire also provides a chatroom.

This is essentially a repackaging of the official binary from frostwire.com.
