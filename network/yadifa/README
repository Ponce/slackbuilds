Lightweight authoritative Name Server with DNSSEC
capabilities. Developed by the passionate people behind the .eu
top-level domain, YADIFA has been built from scratch to face today’s
DNS challenges, with no compromise on security, speed and stability,
to offer a better and safer Internet experience.

Package binaries and shared objects linked here dynamically, but
by-default configure script links it statically, for performance
consideration. Static linking makes sence only on heavy loaded
environment (10+ Mbit DNS traffic, 5000+ queries/second per server).

YADIFA requires its own user in order to run securely. It is not
advised to run services as root user without special reason.


To add yadifa user in system run as root:

# groupadd -g 332 yadifa
# useradd -u 332 -d /var/lib/yadifa -g yadifa -s /bin/false yadifa


In order to run YADIFA during boot process, add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local :

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.yadifa ]; then
	/etc/rc.d/rc.yadifa start
fi

By default this package compiles as shared binaries, but if required
it is possible to build it statically. YADIFA's source by default links
statically, because of performance considerations, but in practice it
takes less effort to support shared linked binaries. But if you really
need it just set environment variable and run SlackBuild:

USESTATIC=yes ./yadifa.SlackBuild

If you use a static build of YADIFA, you should re-build and
re-install the yadifa package each time openssl recieves an update,
to keep your installation secure.
