urlview is a curses program for extracting URLs from text files and
displaying a menu from which you can select a specific URL to view using
your favorite browser program.

It was originally part of mutt. See /etc/urlview.conf on how to configure
mutt, tin, or your default browser.

Please be aware that /etc/urlview.conf and /usr/bin/url_handler.sh are 
configuration files, so they are not overwritten on upgrades.  Be sure to
merge/move the .new files after each upgrade.
