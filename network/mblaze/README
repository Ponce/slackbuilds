mblaze: UNIX utilities to deal with Maildir

The mblaze message system is a set of Unix utilities to deal with mail
messages and Maildir folders. It was inspired by MH, the RAND Message
Handling System, and its command line user interface.

Each utility performs a single function and is designed to be composed
with others using pipelines and shell scripting.
