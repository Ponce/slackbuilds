Browsh is a fully-modern text-based browser. It renders anything that
a modern browser can; HTML5, CSS3, JS, video and even WebGL.
Its main purpose is to be run on a remote server and accessed via
SSH/Mosh or the in-browser HTML service in order to significantly
reduce bandwidth and thus both increase browsing speeds and decrease
bandwidth costs.

Browsh is available as a single static binary on all major platforms.
The only dependency is a recent 57+ version of Firefox.

Pressing F1 opens the documentation, essential to use the browser.

NOTE: This script requires network connection during build.
