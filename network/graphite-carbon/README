graphite-carbon (Backend data caching and persistence daemon for Graphite)

Graphite is a web application using the Twisted framework to provide real-time
visualization and storage of numeric time-series data.  The Carbon daemon
processes the incoming time-series data and saves it as Whisper database files.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
