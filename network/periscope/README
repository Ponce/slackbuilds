Periscope is a subtitles searching module written in python that tries to
find a correct match for a given video file.  The subtitles sites are
handled as plugins and currently support OpenSubtitles, SubtitleSource,
Podnapisi, Subscene and Subtitulos.

A python/nautilus integration script is copied to the doc directory.

This requires pysetuptools and BeautifulSoup.

A rar unpacker is recommended, but it can be avoided if you disable the 
plugins for subtitles sites using this format.
