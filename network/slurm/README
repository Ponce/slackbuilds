Slurm Workload Manager

Slurm is an open-source workload manager designed for Linux clusters of all sizes. 
It provides three key functions. First it allocates exclusive and/or non-exclusive 
access to resources (computer nodes) to users for some duration of time so they can 
perform work. Second, it provides a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring 
work (typically a parallel job) on a set of allocated nodes. Finally, it arbitrates 
contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

The SLURM controller (slurmctld) can run without elevated privileges, 
so it is recommended that a user "slurm" be created for it before Slurm is executed. 

# groupadd -g 311 slurm
# useradd -u 311 -d /var/lib/slurm -s /bin/false -g slurm slurm

Next, a configuration file can be build using your favorite web browser and the 
file /usr/doc/slurm-14.11.8/html/configurator.html.

Optional dependencies:
HWLOC=yes|no (default: no), requires hwloc
RRDTOOL=yes|no (default: no), requires rrdtool
NUMA auto-detected, requires numactl
