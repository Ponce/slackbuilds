w3m is a World Wide Web (WWW) text based client.

Help is avaliable in English, German and Japanese.  There is
an option menu which can be configured for the chosen
lanugage.

It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents
containing links to files residing on the local system, as
well as files residing on remote systems. It can display
HTML tables, frames, and images, and supports tabbed
browsing. In addition, it can be used as a "pager" in much
the same manner as "more" or "less".  w3m can display images
in both the framebuffer, in supported terminals, and the X
server.

Supported consoles for image display are urxvt
(rxvt-unicode) and termite (via a patch), including inside
screen (untested with tmux).

Optional dependency: compface

(Compface converts 48x48x1 images to and from a compressed
format.  The purpose is to allow the inclusion of face
images within mail headers using the field name 'X-face:'.)



SlackBuild Options:

NOMOUSE=1                          to disable mouse support
NOMAILER=1                         disable w3mmailer
GUIBROWSER=/path/to/browser        set the GUI browser
EDITOR=/path/to/editor             set external editor

EG:

NOMOUSE=1 ./w3m.SlackBuild
NOMAILER=1 ./w3m.SlackBuild
GUIBROWSER=/usr/bin/qutebrowser ./w3m.SlackBuild

Or combine any of them together.  By default GUIBROWSER
is set to /usr/bin/firefox.  EDITOR will be picked up from
the environment if set.

These are also settable via the options menu.
