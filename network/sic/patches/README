This directory is for optional patches. Any *.diff files found here
will be applied to the sic source in ASCIIbetical order, when the
SlackBuild is run.

If the order of patches matters (if later ones depend on earlier
ones), name them e.g. 001-foo.diff, 002-bar.diff, etc.

Upstream provides a few patches here:
