sic (simple irc client from suckless.org)

sic is an extremely simple IRC client. It consists of less than 250
lines of code.

You can control the build via environment variables:

IRCHOST - sets the default IRC server (default: irc.oftc.net).
IRCPORT - sets the default port (default: 6667).
SLASH - set SLASH=yes to change the command prefix from a colon (:) to
        a slash (/), to make sic work more like other IRC clients.

For even finer-grained control, you can copy config.def.h from the
sic source to config.h in the SlackBuild directory, and edit it before
building.

If you want to apply any patches to the sic source, see patches/README
for instructions.
