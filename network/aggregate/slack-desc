# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

aggregate: aggregate (optimise a list of route prefixes)
aggregate: 
aggregate: Takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin, and
aggregate: performs two optimisations to attempt to reduce the length of the
aggregate: prefix list. The first optimisation is to remove any supplied
aggregate: prefixes which are superfluous because they are already included in
aggregate: another supplied prefix. For example, 203.97.2.0/24 would be removed
aggregate: if 203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied. The second optimisation
aggregate: identifies adjacent prefixes that can be combined under a single,
aggregate: shorter-length prefix. For example, 203.97.2.0/24 and 203.97.3.0/24
aggregate: can be combined into the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23.
