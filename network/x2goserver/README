x2goserver (X2Go Remote Desktop solution)

X2Go enables you to access a graphical desktop of a computer over
a low bandwidth (or high bandwidth) connection.

You can connect from a computer running Linux, Windows or MacOS X.
Multiple users/clients can access a single X2Go Server at the same time,
with each user/client having an individual Desktop session by default;
however, desktop sharing is possible.

This is the server component.

This script requires a 'x2gouser' user/group to exist before running.
You can create these using:

  groupadd -g 290 x2gouser
  useradd -u 290 -g 290 -c "X2Go Remote Desktop" -M -d /var/lib/x2go -s /bin/false x2gouser
  groupadd -g 291 x2goprint
  useradd -u 291 -g 291 -c "X2Go Remote Desktop" -m -d /var/spool/x2goprint -s /bin/false x2goprint
  chown x2goprint:x2goprint /var/spool/x2goprint
  chmod 0770 /var/spool/x2goprint

Before running the server, you have to initialize the internal database:
  x2godbadmin --createdb

If you want to run the server at boot include it in your /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.x2goserver ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.x2goserver start
fi
