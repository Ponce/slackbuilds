This project develops a third-party plugin for the Pidgin  multi-protocol
instant messenger. It implements the extended version of SIP/SIMPLE used by
various products:

* Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS 2007/2007 R2 and newer)
* Microsoft Live Communications Server (LCS 2003/2005)
* Reuters Messaging
* Skype for Business (Note this is not compatible with the normal Skype)

With this plugin you should be able to replace your Microsoft Office
Communicator or Skype for Business client with Pidgin.
