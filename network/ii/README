Irc it is a minimalist FIFO and filesystem-based IRC client. It creates
an irc directory tree with server, channel and nick name directories. In
every directory a FIFO in file and a normal out file is created. The in
files are used to communicate with servers and the out files contain
server messages. This allows IRC communication from the command line.
