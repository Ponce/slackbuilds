Driftnet is a program designed to capture JPEG and GIF images by sniffing
network traffic and display them in an X window.  Optionally, you may also
capture MPEG audio streams and play them.  According to the author, "It is
a horrific invasion of privacy and shouldn't be used by anyone anywhere."

Original project:  http://www.ex-parrot.com/~chris/driftnet/

This is an updated version available from GitHub, which includes several
patches for use on newer systems.
