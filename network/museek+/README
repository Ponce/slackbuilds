Museek+ is a file-sharing application for the Soulseek peer-to-peer network,
written in C++. It's an enhanced version of Hyriand's original Museek
(see http://museek.thegraveyard.org). It supports chat, transferring files,
searching, user-management, shares browsing and more. The new features are:
room searching, interests, buddy-only shares, banlists, icon themes, and 
font/color selecting.

Museek+ consists of museekd (daemon), muscan (shares scanning tool), muscand
(automated shares scanning tool), musetup (command-line configuration script),
musetup-gtk (PyGTK configuration app), museeq (QT GUI client), mucous (curses
python client), murmur (PyGTK client) and museekcontrol (command-line python 
client).

After installing museek+ follow these steps:
  1) Configure your settings with musetup: server, username, password, 
     interface password, download directory, shared directories.
  2) Run museekd.
  3) Run museeq, mucous, or museekcontrol.
  4) Login into museekd via the interface socket or host:port and the 
     interface password.

This requires scons, libsigc++, libxml++, and libevent.

An example init script (rc.museekd) for the museekd daemon is provided. 
Feel free to modify it for your needs.  Use it at your own risk.
