etm is an acronym for Event and Task Manager. It provides a simple,
intuitive format for using plain text files to store data, a command line
interface for viewing stored information in a variety of convenient ways
and a cross-platform, wx(python)-based GUI for creating and modifying
items as well as viewing them. Displayed items can be grouped by date,
context, keyword or project and can be filtered in various ways.

Requirements

wxPython, pysetuptools and python-dateutil must be installed.  These can
be installed from the SlackBuild repository.

Comment

If you get a codes.py error after running e.py for the first time,
open ~/.etc/rc and edit the encoding lines at the top of the file. Add
f.ex. UTF8 if that is your locale.
