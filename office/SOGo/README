SOGo is a fully supported and trusted groupware server with a focus on
scalability and open standards. SOGo is released under the GNU
GPL/LGPL v2 and above.

SOGo provides a rich AJAX-based Web interface and supports multiple
native clients through the use of standard protocols such as CalDAV,
CardDAV and GroupDAV, as well as Microsoft ActiveSync.

SOGo is the missing component of your infrastructure; it sits in the
middle of your servers to offer your users a uniform and complete
interface to access their information. It has been deployed in
production environments where thousands of users are involved.

The optional extra documentation (PDF files) will be installed if
they are present in the script's directory. You can download these by
running "sh getdocs.sh".

Groupname and Username

You must have the 'sogo' group and user to run this script,
