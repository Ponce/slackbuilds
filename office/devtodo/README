Dev Todo is small command line application for maintaining lists of
outstanding tasks. It stores tasks hierarchically, with each task
given one of five priority levels and a matchin colour level.

Data is stored as XML, so various XSLT templates can be executed
on the XML to convert it into different formats (eg. HTML).
Data is stored in a file named .todo in the current directory.
Depending on the setting of backup in your configuration file, there
may also be files named .todo.1, .todo.2, etc.

Devtodo can display todo items as soon as you change a directory and on
login using these scripts: /usr/doc/devtodo-0.1.20/profile.d/devtodo.{sh,csh}

If you want to enable this feature, the above scripts should be added to
either the system wide shell initialization files (/etc/profile.d/*) or to
a user specific initialization file.
