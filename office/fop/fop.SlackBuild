# 20220305 bkw: Modified by SlackBuilds.org:
# The fop-2.6 SlackBuild downloaded 230 prebuilt .jar files during its
# build process. Since we're trusting prebuilt code anyway, and since
# we prefer not to do network access from a SlackBuild, I've made this
# a binary repack: this script no longer builds fop, it just packages
# the official binary release.
# Also updated for version 2.7, and made this a noarch package since
# there's no native code.
# The offo-hyphenation stuff had to change: we have to use the precompiled
# zip file, not the source. See:
# https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.7/hyphenation.html
