Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. It currently 
supports pdf, postscript, djvu, tiff and dvi. The goal of evince is to 
replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop 
with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the file following formats.
* PDF  * Postscript  * djvu  * tiff  * dvi

This requires dconf to save settings,
even then not ALL settings are saved.
