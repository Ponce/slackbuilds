This is the documentation package for Gnucash.

This builds the internal help and user guides for Gnucash.

For the HTML help and user guides to read outside of the Gnucash
application, pass HTML="yes" to the script.

For the EPUB help and user guides, pass EPUB="yes" to the script.

For the PDF help and user guides, make sure fop is installed and
  configured, and pass PDF="yes" to the script.

After installation, HTML, EPUB, and PDF documentation can be found
in /usr/doc/gnucash-$VERSION.

For a specific language, pass DOCLANG="xx", where xx is:
C for English (default)
de for German
it for Italian
pt for Portugese
ja for Japanese (guide only, no help - defaults to C)
ru for Russian (guide only, no help - defaults to C)

Note 1: This script builds the internal guides in all available
languages, but the HTML guides are only in the spacified language
to save space and avoid excessive package bloat.

Note 2: This builds the docs for version 4.x of Gnucash.  If you
need the old stable 2.6 branch, use gnucash-legacy-docs, also
available on SBo.
