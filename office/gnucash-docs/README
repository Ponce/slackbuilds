This is the documentation package for Gnucash.

This builds the internal help and user guides for Gnucash.

For the HTML help and user guides to read outside of the Gnucash
application, pass HTML="yes" to the script.

For the epub help and user guides, pass EPUB="yes" to the script.

For the mobi (Amazon Kindle) help and user guides, make sure
  calibre-bin is installed, and pass MOBI="yes" to the script.
  (Note: mobi is generated from epub, so this generates epub files
  as well.)

For the PDF help and user guides, make sure fop is installed and
  configured, and pass PDF="yes" to the script.

After installation, HTML, EPUB, MOBI and PDF documentation can be found
in /usr/doc/gnucash-$VERSION.

For a specific language, pass DOCLANG="xx", where xx is:
C for English (default)
de for German
it for Italian
pt for Portugese
ja for Japanese (guide only, no help - defaults to C)
NOTE: the Russian translation has been dropped

Note: This script builds the internal guides in all available
languages, but the HTML guides are only in the spacified language
to save space and avoid excessive package bloat.

Runtime dependencies are yelp and rarian.
