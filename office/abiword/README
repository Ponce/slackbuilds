The AbiWord word processor is a lightweight and featureful
productivity tool that is suitable for a wide variety of word
processing tasks.

goffice and gnome-vfs are optional dependencies, but gnome-vfs doesn't
add anything useful.

evince is an optional runtime dependency since it's the
default application to show print previews, but you can avoid
it by adding something like this to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:
gtk-print-preview-command="xpdf -q %f"

asio is an optional dependency. It enables the TCP collaboration
plugin.  If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.
