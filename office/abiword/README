The AbiWord word processor is a lightweight and featureful productivity 
tool that is suitable for a wide variety of word processing tasks.

goffice and gnome-vfs are optional dependencies, but gnome-vfs doesn't add

evince is an optional runtime dependency since it's the default application
to show print previews, but you can avoid it by adding something like this
to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:  gtk-print-preview-command="xpdf -q %f"
