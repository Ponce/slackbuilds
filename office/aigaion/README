Aigaion Web-based Bibliography Management System

Aigaion provides a bibliography management software environment
that supports a user in organizing and managing a complete
bibliography, from small bibliographies to bibliographies for a
complete research department.

To complete installation:

  1) Create a new MySQL database '<db_aigaion2>', with an appropriate user.
     The database is empty.
  2) Point your browser to:
     http://<server>/<aigaion2_rootdir>/install/install.php

From there on, follow the instructions on the screen.
