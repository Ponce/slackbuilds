OpenProj - an open source project managing office application

OpenProj is a desktop replacement for Microsoft Project. It is capable of
sharing files with Microsoft Project and has very similar functionality 
(Gantt, PERT diagram, histogram, charts, reports, detailed usage), as well as 
tree views which aren't in MS Project.
