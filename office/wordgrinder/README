WordGrinder is a simple, Unicode-aware word processor that runs on
the console. It's designed to get the hell out of your way and let you
write; it does very little, but what it does it does well.

It supports basic paragraph styles, basic character styles, basic
screen markup, a menu interface that means you don't have to remember
complex key sequences, HTML import and export, and some other useful
features.
