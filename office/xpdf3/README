XPDF is a longstanding PDF reader for Linux, this package installs the
older 3.04 version. Unlike the 4.x branch which uses the Qt toolkit,
the classic versions of XPDF used motif. The older version is useful
if you need a very lightweight PDF reader, if you run a Slackware
installation without Qt or if you simply prefer the retro esthetics
of motif. This program is renamed xpdf3, so as not to conflict with
the 4.x version that is installed by default on Slackware.
