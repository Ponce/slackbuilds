# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xpdf3: xpdf3 (classic motif based xpdf)
xpdf3:
xpdf3: XPDF is a longstanding PDF reader for Linux, this package installs
xpdf3: older 3.04 version. Unlike the 4.x branch which uses the Qt toolkit,
xpdf3: the classic versions of XPDF used motif. The older version is useful
xpdf3: if you need a very lightweight PDF reader, if you run a Slackware
xpdf3: installation without Qt or if you simply prefer the retro esthetics
xpdf3: of motif. This program is renamed xpdf3, so as not to conflict with
xpdf3: the 4.x version that is installed by default on Slackware.
