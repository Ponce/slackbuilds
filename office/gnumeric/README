The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the GNOME desktop environment: 
a project to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.
The goal of Gnumeric is to be the best possible spreadsheet. We are 
not attempting to clone existing applications. However, Gnumeric can 
read files saved with other spreadsheets and we offer a customizable 
feel that attempts to minimize the costs of transition.
