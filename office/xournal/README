Xournal is an application for notetaking, sketching, keeping a
journal using a stylus. It is free software (GNU GPL) and runs on
Linux (recent distributions) and other GTK+/Gnome platforms. It is
similar to Microsoft Windows Journal or to other alternatives such as
Jarnal and Gournal.

This requires libgnomecanvas available from SlackBuilds.org.
