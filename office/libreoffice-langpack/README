Language Pack for LibreOffice productivity suite.

This script builds the language pack for the en-GB locale.
To build other locales, download your language pack from:

  http://www.libreoffice.org/download/

and start the SlackBuild as follows:

  # LOLANG=xx ./libreoffice-langpack.SlackBuild

This package was prepared for LibreOffice built from here at
SlackBuilds.org. if you want to build a package compatible with
LibreOffice built from source (like AlienBOB's packages), start the
script as follows:

  # LOLANG=xx ALIEN=yes ./libreoffice-langpack.SlackBuild

Note:
For language used in multiple locale, please replace xx with xx-YY
