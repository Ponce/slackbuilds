# Slackware build script for mupdf

# Originally written by Hubert Hesse (email removed).
# Heavily modified by B. Watson (urchlay@slackware.uk).

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20240813 bkw: update for 1.24.8.
# 20240314 bkw: update for 1.23.11.
# 20230531 bkw: BUILD=2, actually use SLKCFLAGS.
# 20230117 bkw: update for 1.21.1.
# - Again, this script can't build older versions.
# - There's a gumbo-parser SlackBuild now, so build with it instead of
#   upstream's bundled version.
# - tesseract builds work, so make that an option.
# - Include pre-scaled PNG icons.

# 20201020 bkw: update for 1.18.0. See notes, below.
# 20200217 bkw: update for 1.16.1.
# 20180623 bkw: BUILD=2, add patch for dynamic linking. Thanks
#               to Thomas Morper for pointing me in the right direction.
# 20180615 bkw: update for 1.13.0, move old change comments to ChangeLog.old
# 20180101 bkw: update for 1.12.0.
# 20170711 bkw: update for 1.11.
# 20170621 bkw: fix build with -current's newer openjpeg, BUILD=2.
# 20170122 bkw: update for 1.10a.

# Notes for 1.18.0:
# - This script can no longer build older versions, too many changes.
# - Upstream *finally* supports building as a shared library, so I and
#   all other distro packagers can stop patching it... except the
#   shared lib is unversioned, which means upgrades would cause more
#   breakage than they should. So there's still some trickery here to
#   build a versioned solib.
# - I've got rid of the STATIC=yes option and now only build shared libs.
#   As a side effect, libmupdf-third is gone, but I've included a
#   placeholder so stuff that links with it, will work without patching.
# - gumbo (HTML parser) is now a hard dep. The source is bundled, so
#   there's no need to create a new gumbo SlackBuild, but it does mean
#   the mupdf shared lib has grown in size.
# - mupdf-gl uses freeglut. The version we have in 14.2 is new enough to
#   build with, but old enough that you can't copy text from mupdf-gl.
#   So we build the bundled version here.
# - API docs are now included in the package.
# - Now using upstream's icons, including scalable SVG.
# - Add missing doinst.sh
# - There's now the option to build with tesseract and leptonica,
#   but it's disabled in this script. I have yet to get it to
#   actually *do* anything other than fail to build (when using
#   upstream's tesseract/leptonica forks) or complain about being
#   unable to load eng.traineddata (using SBo tesseract/leptonica,
#   and yes eng.traineddata is fine). Until I work out what's wrong,
#   or upstream releases a new version, this script doesn't support
#   building with tesseract. Don't contact me about this before March
#   1, 2021, unless you actually have a patch that fixes it. After
#   that, if this message is still here, feel free to remind me to
#   revisit it.
# - Slackware 14.2's libcrypto (from openssl) is too old for mupdf,
#   and there's no bundled souce for it. So currently mupdf is being
#   built without libcrypto. Hope that's OK.

  # Historically, mupdf has included two libraries: libmupdf itself,
  # and libmupdf-third, containing all the bundled third party code
  # included with the source. In version >=1.18.0, when building a
  # shared lib, no libmupdf-third gets created (all the code ends up in
  # libmupdf.so). However, most projects that link with libmupdf expect
  # this library to exist. This will probably change in the future as
  # those projects get updated for the changes in mupdf, but for now,
  # to be compatible with older mupdf versions, we include an empty
  # libmupdf-third for stuff to link with.
