# Slackware build script for mupdf

# Originally written by Hubert Hesse (slackbuilds@hubertscorner.de).
# Heavily modified by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com).

# 20150915 bkw BUILD=2:
# - add -DJBIG_NO_MEMENTO, needed for building with jbig2dec-0.12.

# 20150511 bkw:
# - version bump to 1.7a.
# - remembered to reset BUILD to 1, yay.
# - no other changes (amazingly enough).

# 20140827 bkw: fix quality control fails in previous version.
# 2 issues pointed out by Thomas Morper in an email:
# - The source is already found in upstream's archive/, and won't get
#   moved, so update DOWNLOAD in the .info file to point there.
# - Get rid of redundant /usr/share/doc/mupdf dir.
#
# Also, I forgot to reset BUILD to 1 when VERSION changed, so this
# will be build "4" of 1.5 even thought it's really the 2nd one :(

# 20140822 bkw:
# - Updated for mupdf-1.5.
# - Hosting the source on my server, so I know it won't get moved
#   to an archive/ dir when a new release comes out.
# - Script also tested with 1.4:
#   DOWNLOAD="http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/mupdf-1.4-source.tar.gz"
#   MD5SUM="0f6840a7020db0c833b0c090ca1864ec"
# - Add .desktop, .pc, icon
# - Got rid of CVE-2014-2013 patch (integrated by upstream in 1.4).
# - Remove man page patch (not needed for 1.4 and up).
# - Replace openjpeg dep with newly-submitted openjpeg2.
# - Small patch to allow building with openjpeg 2.1.0 (rather than 2.0.0).
# - For now, revert to static libmupdf. Upstream doesn't support
#   shared libs, they hate it when distro packages create them,
#   and rolling my own shared libs is more PITA than it's worth.
# - Upstream renamed the binary to mupdf-x11, add symlinks so scripts
#   or .desktop files can still run it as mupdf, and "man mupdf" will
#   still work.

# 20140224 bkw:
# - backported security fix for CVE-2014-2013. I will be upgrading this
#   build to mupdf-1.3, but it'll take more work than I currently have
#   time for:
#   + mupdf's internals have changed, will have to redo my patches
#   + it depends on openjpeg 2.0 which SBo hasn't got yet. 2.0 uses an
#     incompatible API, so an openjpeg 2.0 SlackBuild would require
#     updates for everything that depends on it.
#   + zathura-pdf-mupdf will need updating (mupdf's API has changed)
#   + probably all the other zathura-* builds will need updating to
#     be compatible with new zathura-pdf-mupdf
#   The security fix is needed now, it's a tiny patch, and shouldn't have
#   to wait on all that other stuff.

# 20140318 bkw: fix permissions on headers and man pages.

# 20130618 bkw:
# - Took over maintenance.
# - Updated for mupdf 1.2.
# - Build library shared, not static.
# - Build with system zlib, libjpeg, openjpeg, jbig2dec, libtiff, libpng,
#   liblcms2 instead of bundled sources (which made the lib + exes *huge*).
#   Also, the included libjpeg is too new (it broke zathura-pdf-mupdf).
# - Include mutool in package (instead of just its man page).
# - Add CHANGES CONTRIBUTORS doc/* to /usr/doc.
# - Use DESTDIR libdir mandir instead of patching makefile.
# - Updated README & slack-desc to mention XPS and CBZ.
# - Fix the man pages slightly.
