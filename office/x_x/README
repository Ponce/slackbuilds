x_x (view Excel or CSV files in the terminal)

x_x (The Dead Guy CLI) is a command line reader that displays either
Excel files or CSVs in your terminal. The purpose of this is to not
break the workflow of people who live on the command line and need to
access a spreadsheet generated using Microsoft Excel.

By default, x_x is built for python2. If you have python3 installed
and would prefer to use it, run the script with 'export PYVER=3' in
the environment. There's apparently no functional difference in x_x
between the python 2 and 3 builds, although the python2 version emits
warnings about unicode_literals.
