BRISS aims to offer a simple cross-platform (Linux, Windows, Mac OSX)
application for cropping PDF files. A simple user interface lets you define
exactly the crop-region by fitting a rectangle on the visually overlaid pages.
It's licensed under GPL.
To build the package and run this program a Java runtime environment (JRE) is
enough.
