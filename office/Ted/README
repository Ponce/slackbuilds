Ted (a lightweight WYSIWYG word processor)

Ted is a lightweight word processor that uses the RTF format. It
supports multiple fonts and can print to PostScript printers. Ted is
simple to use and starts up quickly.

Additional packages with spellcheckers for different languages exist
and can be downloaded from the Ted homepage.

Ted can be built with with GTK+ or Motif widgets. The default is GTK+,
which is generally more modern-looking than Motif... but if you use
WindowMaker, the GTK+ Ted won't work.

To build with Motif, pass MOTIF=yes to the script. This makes Ted
work under WindowMaker, but you might experience minor visual glitches
in properties input boxes while inputting non-ASCII strings, e.g. in
the author field.
