Ted is a lightweight Word-processor that uses the RTF-format. It supports 
multiple fonts and can print to PostScript printers. Ted is simple to use,
is easily compiled.

Additional packages with spellcheckers for different languages exist and 
can be downloaded from the Ted homepage.

While Ted builds with the GTK+ widgets by default, you can build Ted
with Motif widgets by passing WIDGET=motif variable to the script. This
will also make Ted work under Window Maker but you might experience
minor visual glitches in properties input boxes while inputting
non-ASCII strings, e.g. in the author field.
