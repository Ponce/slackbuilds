Wyrd is a text-based front-end to Remind, a sophisticated calendar
and alarm program. Remind's power lies in its programmability, and
Wyrd does not hide this capability behind flashy GUI dialogs. Rather,
Wyrd is designed to make you more efficient at editing your reminder
files directly. It also offers a scrollable timetable suitable for
visualizing your schedule at a glance.

Wyrd requires OCaml and Remind (both available at SlackBuilds.org).
