KBGOffice is inheritor of the popular dictionary KBEDictionary.
It provides easy to use interface for the dictionaries from the
Bulgarian Office project. Currently KBGOffice supports all the five
dictionaries (English <=> Bulgarian, Polytechnical, Computer Terms,
Thesaurus and Dialect)

This requires the "full-pack" package (runtime-only dependency).
