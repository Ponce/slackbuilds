jfbview (framebuffer PDF and image viewer)

jfbview is a PDF and image viewer for the Linux framebuffer. It's fast
and has some advanced features including:
  * Arbitrary zoom (10% - 1000%) and rotation;
  * Table of Contents (TOC) viewer for PDF documents;
  * Interactive text search for PDF documents;
  * Multi-threaded rendering;
  * Asynchronous background pre-caching;
  * Customizable multi-threaded caching.

Optional dependency: imlib2 (autodetected). This will allow jfbview to
work as an image viewer as well as a PDF viewer.
