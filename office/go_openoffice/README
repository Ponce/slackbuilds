Go-oo is a fork of the OpenOffice.org Office Suite.

Go-oo has built in OpenXML  import filters and it will import your Microsoft
Works files. Compared with up-stream OO.o, it has better Microsoft binary
file support (with eg. fields  support), and it will import WordPerfect
graphics beautifully. If you are reliant on Excel VBA macros - then Go-oo
offers the best macro fidelity too. If you expect your spreadsheets to
calculate compatibly, or you get embedded Visio diagrams in your documents,
you'll want Go-oo.

NOTE: This build needs about 12 GB in $TMP and the source is about 430 MB
to download.  It also takes hours to compile.  This build is still a "work
in progress" - due to the long build time, it is very hard to QA test.

NOTE2: Don't forget to source /etc/profile if you just installed jdk. In fact, 
it is a good idea to do this after you use su and before you run any SlackBuild.

This requires xulrunner, Archive-Zip, icu4c, apache-ant, and jdk from /extra in 
Slackware.

Optional requirements are avahi, openclipart, ORBit2, GConf, and gnome-vfs.

Variables that can be passed to the SlackBuild script:
ARTPATH     Path to openclipart; leave unset to disable.
NVIDIA=no   Turns off an nvidia build work around.
LINGUAS_OOO Sets the languages to add.
PLUGIN=no   Disable openoffice's mozilla plugin.
KDE=no      Disable KDE4 UI.
GTK=no      Disable GTK UI.
GNOME=yes   Enables optional gnome bits.
MYCONF      Used to pass extra configure options.
