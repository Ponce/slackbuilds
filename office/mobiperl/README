mobiperl (tools for generating and manipulating MobiPocket files)

MobiPocket (.mobi) is a file format used by e-book readers on desktop
PCs and platforms such as the Kindle.

Included tools:

html2mobi - convert HTML files to .mobi
lit2mobi  - convert LIT files to .mobi  [1]
mobi2html - convert .mobi files to HTML
mobi2mobi - manipulate metadata in .mobi files
mobils    - list contents (metadata) of .mobi files
opf2mobi  - convert OPF files to .mobi  [2]

[1] For lit2mobi to work, office/convertlit must be installed. Even
    then, it doesn't seem to work particularly well.

[2] opf2mobi doesn't seem to actually work. If someone manages to fix
    it, please let the maintainer know.
