pstoedit converts PostScript and PDF files to various vector graphic 
formats. The resulting files can be edited or imported into various 
drawing packages. Output formats include: AI, ASY, CGM, DXF, EMF, FIG, 
GMFA, GMFI, GSCHEM, HPGL, IDRAW, KIL, LATEX2E, LWO, MIF, MNA, MPOST, 
NOIXML, PCB, PCL, RIB, RPL, RTF, SK, SVG, SVM, SWF, TGIF, XAML, WMF and  
variants of these. Output is also possible to text in different formats 
and Java or TK code.

This version has some incompatibilities with ghostscript versions
earlier than 9.50 (eg 9.26 as in Slackware 14.4). If you get errors try 
using the option "-rdb". 

libEMF, plotutils, and ming are optional dependencies.
