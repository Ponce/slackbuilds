re-typeset (resize scanned text images)

This software is a GUI application which re-typesets scanned pages to
smaller sizes without changing font sizes. Words are found on pages and
placed in a new, smaller image with preserved paragraphs, page numbers,
headers, etc.

See the upstream website for documentation.
