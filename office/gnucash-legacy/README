GnuCash is personal and small-business financial-accounting software,
freely licensed under the GNU GPL and available for GNU/Linux, BSD,
Solaris, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows.

Designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible, GnuCash
allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses.
As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based
on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and
accurate reports.

Pass OFX="yes" for OFX (USA) (requies libofx)

Pass WITHPYTHON="yes" to enable Python bindings for report gereration.

Note that the AQ="yes/no" switch has been removed as this version of
gnucash will not build with the new versions of aqbanking; the older
versions of aqbanking are not only obsolete, but no longer available.

If you want the SQL database integration, you must first have libdbi
and libdbi-drivers installed, and then pass the DBI="yes" flag.

NOTE:  You must remove any previous installation of Gnucash before
running this script, otherwise the build will fail. 

This script builds version 2.6.21, which upstream is calling the
"last last" release of the 2.6 series.
