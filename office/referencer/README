Referencer is a GNOME application to organize documents or references,
and ultimately generate a BibTeX bibliography file. 

Referencer includes a number of features to make this process easier:

1) Automatic metadata retrieval from PubMed, CrossRef and ArXiv
2) Smart web links
3) Import from BibTeX, Reference Manager and EndNote
4) Tagging

An optional, run-time dependency is yelp.
