latex2rtf is a translator program to convert LaTeX formatted text files into
"rich text format" (RTF) files. RTF is a published standard format by
Microsoft. This standard can be ambiguous in places, but RTF is supported by
many text editors. Specifically, it is supported by Microsoft Word. This means
that the conversion of a LaTeX document to RTF allows anyone with a copy of
Word to convert LaTeX files to Word .doc or .docx files.

Features

- Conversion of a wide range of input encodings
- Conversion of equations (unfortunately using the broken Microsoft
  implementation of EQ fields)
- Conversion of tables
- Conversion of graphics
- Conversion of cross-references
- Conversion of bibliographies 

latex2rtf translates the text and as much of the formatting information from
LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output is not nearly as good as
what you would get from using LaTeX directly.
