# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

minidjvu: minidjvu (bitonal single-page DjVu encoder/decoder)
minidjvu:
minidjvu: Minidjvu is a command line utility which encodes and decodes single
minidjvu: page black-and-white DjVu files, and can compress multiple pages,
minidjvu: taking advantage from similarities between pages.  Supported bitmap
minidjvu: formats are PBM, Windows BMP, and TIFF (through libtiff).  Minidjvu
minidjvu: is based on DjVuLibre, which is the primary DjVu support library.
minidjvu: Minidjvu is not going to support all DjVu functionality; the idea is
minidjvu: rather to take the black-and-white part (also called JB2) and
minidjvu: experiment with it.
