vmd (Terminal Markdown Viewer)

Render markdown in a terminal! Why? Because although Markdown is still
readable as-is, if you use Markdown a lot, it's nice to have something to
render it with the proper formatting - with bold text and emphasis, etc.

This package requires Markdown compiled with python3 support

Also, this version is patched to ignore img tags, which make vmd fail
parsing certain markdown documents.
