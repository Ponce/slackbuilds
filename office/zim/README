Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki
pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting,
and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an
outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as
linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files
with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional
functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray
icon, and support for version control.

Zim can be used to:

    Keep an archive of notes
    Keep a daily or weekly journal
    Take notes during meetings or lectures
    Organize task lists
    Draft blog entries and emails
    Do brainstorming


NOTE:
Zim can be expanded with plugins.  From 'preferences' go to
'plugins' and anything marked 'failed' can be installed either
from SBo or pip.  These aren't dependencies; Zim runs without them.
