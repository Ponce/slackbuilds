Verbiste is a French conjugation system.

Verbiste contains a C++ library, two programs (a french-conjugator and a
french-deconjugator) that can be run from the command line or from another 
program, and a GTK application (verbiste-gtk).  The knowledge base is 
represented in XML and contains over 7000 verbs There is also a small 
Italian dictionary of 120 verbs.  The graphical interface lets the user 
look up a verb in one or both languages.

This requires wxGTK.
