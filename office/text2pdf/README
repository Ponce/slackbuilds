text2pdf (Converts text files to PDF)

text2pdf makes a 7-bit clean PDF file (version 1.1) from any input file. It
reads from standard input or a named file, and writes the PDF file to
standard output.  You can specify the font, number of lines and columns,
paper size and various other options from the command line. By default, long
lines will be wrapped, and a formfeed character (^L) will cause a page break.
