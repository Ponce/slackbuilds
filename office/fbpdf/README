fbpdf (PDF viewer for the Linux framebuffer)

fbpdf is a framebuffer pdf/djvu file viewer. It can use either mupdf
or poppler libraries for rendering pdf files and it uses the djvulibre
library for rendering djvu files.

Optional dependency: mupdf.

By default, the fbpdf2 (poppler support) executable is built, along
with fbdjvu. If you want mupdf support, install mupdf before running
this build and it will be auto-detected. The executable that uses
mupdf will be called fbpdf. mupdf's rendering is usually faster
and better-looking than poppler's. If you have mupdf installed,
but want to build fbpdf without it, export MUPDF=no in the script's
environment.

This build includes a patch that makes the keyboard controls behave more
like other PDF readers. Mainly, it lets you page through the entire
document with the space bar (and backspace to go back), rather than
requiring separate keystrokes for "scroll within current page" and "go
to next page". If you prefer the original behaviour, set PRISTINE=yes
in the script's environment.
