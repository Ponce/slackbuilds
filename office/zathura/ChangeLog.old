# 20180909 bkw:
# - Re-enable building with synctex, since texlive has been fixed. This
#   requires a patch, since this version of zathura was written for an
#   older version of texlive.

# 20180903 bkw:
# - Disable building with synctex, since it currently doesn't work due
#   to a bug in the texlive package. Will be re-enabled when the texlive
#   issue is fixed.
# - Really get rid of color output from the Makefile. I know it's cute,
#   but it confuses less when redirecting to a file.

# 20180102 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.8. Have to do some fudging to get it to build with
#   Slack 14.2's older glib2: upstream claims they need 2.50, but the
#   only thing they seem to need it for is the --dependency-file option
#   to glib-compile-resources, which turns out to be unneeded.

# 20170711 bkw:
# - BUILD=2
# - Include API docs in package
# - Switch to github URLs since upstream's site has been broken for 3-4
#   days now. Side effect is, it makes it easier for my update script to
#   let me know when there's a new release. This means adding the built
#   man pages to SBo git (otherwise I'd have Sphinx as a dep, yuck).

# 20170125 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.7, poppler plugin v0.2.7

# 20160725 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.3.6

# 20150511 bkw:
# - Version bump 0.3.3. The poppler plugin is still on 0.2.5.
# - Make the poppler plugin's pdf.so a symlink. Will do the same
#   for zathura-pdf-mupdf, to allow switching between the two without
#   reinstalling packages. This wouldn't have worked with older versions,
#   due to changes in glib's g_file_test() between glib 1.x and 2.x.
# - Upstream started using -fdiagnostics-color=always, which is only
#   supported in newer gcc versions. Get rid of it.
