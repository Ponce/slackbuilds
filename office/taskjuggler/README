TaskJuggler is project management software for serious project managers.
It covers the complete spectrum of project management tasks from the first idea to the completion of the project.
It assists you during project scoping, resource assignment, cost and revenue planning, risk and communication management.

TaskJuggler provides an optimizing scheduler that computes your project time lines and resource
assignments based on the project outline and the constraints that you have provided.
The built-in resource balancer and consistency checker offload you from having to worry about irrelevant details and ring
the alarm if the project gets out of hand.

The flexible as-many-details-as-necessary approach allows you to plan your project as you go, making it also ideal for new
management strategies such as Extreme Programming and Agile Project Management.
