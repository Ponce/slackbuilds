Tellico is a KDE application for keeping track of your collections.  It 
provides default templates for books, bibliographies, videos, music, coins,
stamps, trading cards, comic books, and wines.  Ultimately, the goal is for
it to be similar in capability to AVCataloger or Readerware, although it's 
still got a ways to go.

Tellico allows you to enter your collection in a catalogue database, saving
many different properties like title, author, etc. Two different views of 
your collection are shown. On the left, your entries are grouped together
by any field you like, allowing you to see how many are in each group. On
the right, selected fields are shown in column format, allowing you to sort
by any field. On the bottom is a customizable HTML view of the current
entry. The entry editor is a dialog box where you enter the data.  You can
even read barcodes with a webcam.

yaz, exempi and qjson are optional (but recommended) dependencies.
