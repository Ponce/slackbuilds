The ccal utility is a simple-to-use command line program which writes a Gregorian calendar
together with Chinese Lunar calendar to standard output.
Its usage is similar to the cal program generally available on Unix platforms.
In addition to console output, it can also generate Encapsulated Postscript and HTML table outputs
for use in do-it-yourself calendars and web pages.
It supports both simplified and traditional Chinese characters.
