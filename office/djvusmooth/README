djvusmooth (graphical editor for DjVu documents)

djvusmooth is a graphical editor for DjVu files, which allows one to:

- edit document metadata,
- edit document outline (bookmarks),
- add, remove or edit hyperlinks,
- correct occasional errors in the hidden text layer.

Although wxPython is listed as a required dependency, it may be possible
to use wxPython3 instead (not tested by SlackBuild author).
