TeXLive (TeXLive binaries, support files, TeX formats)

This package contains all binaries (including xindy, asymptote, and biber) 
and many support files, TeX formats and packages, and other files included
in the TeXLive TeX distribution.  This should be adequate for the needs of
most TeX users.

The remaining stuff can be found in texlive-extra, texlive-fonts, and 
texlive-docs, all of which are also available at SlackBuilds.org.

ConTeXt is currently not supported.

Have a look at the scripts in the prep/ directory  to see how the texmf
archives were created from the original Texlive netarchives.

Note that this package conflicts with the tetex packages in Slackware, 
so you'll need to remove tetex and tetex-doc before installing TeXLive.
