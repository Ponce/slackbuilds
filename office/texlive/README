TeXLive (TeXLive binaries, support files, TeX formats)

This package contains the binaries, support files, TeX formats and packages,
and other files required for the TeXLive TeX distribution.  Included are 
input files for TeX, runtime configuration files, hyphenation tables, 
manpages, and the computer modern fonts.

The resulting package is very large, and a lot of space is required during
the build process, so you might want to consider defining an alternate 
location for TMP and OUTPUT if you have small /tmp partition.

Note that this package is intended to completely replace (and then some) the
tetex packages in Slackware, so you'll need to remove tetex and tetex-doc
before installing TeXLive (but NOT before BUILDING it).  For the sake of
clarity, this means that you must have the tetex package installed when
you build texlive the first time; after that, the texlive package that's
already installed is sufficient.

Have a look at the texscythe package to see how the texmf tarball was
created from the original download from upstream.
