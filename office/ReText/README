ReText is a simple but powerful editor for Markdown and 
reStructuredText markup languages. ReText is written in
Python language and works on Linux and other POSIX-
compatible platforms. 

It has some optional dependencies, e.g. Pygments, MarkupSafe,
docutils, Markdown, etc.
This depends on the functions you enabled in ReText.
