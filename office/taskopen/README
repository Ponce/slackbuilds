Taskopen allows you to link almost any file, webpage or command
to a taskwarrior task by adding a filepath, web-link or uri as an
annotation. Text notes, images, PDF files, web addresses, spreadsheets and
many other types of links can then be filtered, listed and opened by using
taskopen. Some actions are sane defaults, others can be custom-configured,
and everything else will use your systems mime-types to open the link.
