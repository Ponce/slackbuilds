# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tophat: aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra
tophat: high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the
