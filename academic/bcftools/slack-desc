# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

bcftools: bcftools (BCF calling tools)
bcftools:
bcftools: bcftools contains all the "vcf..." commands which previously lived in 
bcftools: the htslib repository (such as vcfcheck, vcfmerge, vcfisec, etc.) and 
bcftools: the samtools BCF calling from bcftools subdirectory of the previous 
bcftools: samtools. BCFtools are meant as a faster replacement for most of the 
bcftools: perl VCFtools commands. Bcftools comes with its own hstlib sources.
