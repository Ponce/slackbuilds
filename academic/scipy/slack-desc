# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

scipy: The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides
scipy: many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines
scipy: for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all
scipy: popular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of
scipy: charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be
scipy: depended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.
