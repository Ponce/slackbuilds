ParMETIS (Parallel Graph Partitioning and Fill-reducing Matrix  Ordering)

ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety 
of algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs, meshes, and for 
computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices.

Set precision type:
DP=yes (for 64-bit, default is 32-bit)

The requirement is a MPI implementation, either mpich or openmpi.
