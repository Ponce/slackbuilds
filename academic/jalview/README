Jalview - A Sequence Alignment Editor and Viewer

Jalview is a free program developed for the interactive editing,
analysis and visualization of multiple sequence alignments (MSA). It
can also work with sequence annotation, secondary structure
information, phylogenetic trees and 3D molecular structures.

If you use Jalview 2 in your work, please cite:

NOTE1:
The silly requirement of p7zip is just for extracting the program's
contents at build time. You do not need it in order to use Jalview
later on, but it's a nice tool to have anyways... ;)

NOTE2:
The 'source' is hosted at SourceForge by the SlackBuild maintainer.
