labplot2 (interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data)

LabPlot is a KDE-application for interactive graphing and analysis of
scientific data.

LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots. It allows
you to produce plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on data imported
from external files. Plots can be exported to several pixmap and vector
graphic formats.

LabPlot2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot1 and lacks in the first release
a lot of features available in the predecessor. On the other hand, the
GUI and the usability is more superior as compared to LabPlot1 and there
are several new features that were not available in LabPlot1.

optional dependencies:

- LaTeX (to enable LaTeX typesetting in LabPlot)
- fftw
- hdf5
- netcdf
- cfitsio
