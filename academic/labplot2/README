LabPlot2 - (interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data)

LabPlot is a KDE-application for interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data.
LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots.
It allows you to produce plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on data imported from external files.
Plots can be exported to several pixmap and vector graphic formats.

LabPlot2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot1 and lacks in the first release a lot of features available
in the predecessor. On the other hand, the GUI and the usability is more superior as compared to LabPlot1
and there are several new features that were not available in LabPlot1.

gsl is an optional dependency.
