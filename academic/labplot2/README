labplot2 (interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data)

LabPlot is a KDE-application for interactive graphing and analysis of
scientific data.

LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots. It
allows you to produce plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on
data imported from external files. Plots can be exported to several
pixmap and vector graphic formats.

LabPlot2 is a complete rewrite of LabPlot1 and lacks in the first
release a lot of features available in the predecessor. On the other
hand, the GUI and the usability is more superior as compared to
LabPlot1 and there are several new features that were not available
in LabPlot1.

optional dependencies:

- LaTeX (to enable LaTeX typesetting in LabPlot)
- fftw
- hdf5
- netcdf
- cfitsio
