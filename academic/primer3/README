Primer3 is a widely used program for designing PCR primers. Primer3 
can also design hybridization probes and sequencing primers. PCR is 
used for many different goals. Consequently, primer3 has many 
different input parameters that you control and that tell primer3 
exactly what characteristics make good primers for your goals.
