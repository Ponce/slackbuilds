FastQC: A quality control tool for high throughput sequence data

FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks
on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines.
It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a
quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you
should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are

- Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be
  problems
- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
  running the interactive application
