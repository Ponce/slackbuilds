# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

qhull: Qhull (Implements the Quickhull Algorithm)
qhull:
qhull: Qhull computes  the  convex  hull,  Delaunay   triangulation,  Voronoi
qhull: diagram, halfspace intersection  about a point, furthest-site Delaunay
qhull: triangulation, and furthest-site Voronoi diagram. The source code runs
qhull: in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the Quickhull
qhull: algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull handles roundoff errors
qhull: from floating point arithmetic. It computes volumes, surface areas,
qhull: and approximations to the convex hull.
