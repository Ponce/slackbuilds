MPQC is the Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program.
It computes properties of atoms and molecules from first principles
using the time independent Schrödinger equation. Methods supported
are: HF, MP2 AND DFT for energies and gradients, OPT2 and ZAPT2
for energies.

MPQC requires blas and lapack.
