AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of
rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration. It employs an extended
vortex lattice model for the lifting surfaces, together with a
slender-body model for fuselages and nacelles. General nonlinear flight
states can be specified. The flight dynamic analysis combines a full
linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state, together
with specified mass properties.
