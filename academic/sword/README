The SWORD Project is an effort to create an ever expanding software package 
for research and study of God and His Word.  The SWORD Bible Framework allows 
easy manipulation of Bible texts, commentaries, lexicons, dictionaries, etc. 
Many frontends are build using this framework. An installed module set may 
be shared between any frontend using the framework.  

This engine/library needs data to operate on to be usefull.

A sword-data-kjv package is available on sbo to provide a basic bible with
strongs and Greek and Hebrew dictionaries for use with this library. Many
more bibles, commentries etc. can be found on the crosswire.org website.
modules can be downloaded in raw format (zip) and extracted into the
/usr/share/sword  directory.
