Vernier LoggerPro (data-collection and analysis software)

Vernier Software & Technology is the leader in educational data
collection technology. Since 1981, we have developed affordable,
award-winning interfaces, sensors, software, and standards-based 
curriculum.  This package installs files to allow either LoggerPro 
or LoggerLite to access devices.

Sadly, this package installs two symlinks into /usr/local/share/
and one symlink into /usr/local/bin/ - the /usr/local/ directory
is hardcoded into the LoggerPro files somewhere, and I've not
been able to figure out where or how to correct it...
