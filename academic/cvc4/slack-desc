# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cvc4: cvc4 (a first-order theorem prover and SMT solver)
cvc4:
cvc4: CVC4 is an automated theorem prover and satisfiability modulo
cvc4: theories (SMT) solver. Given a formula in first-order logic, it
cvc4: attempts to either prove the formula or find a counterexample. CVC4
cvc4: supports arithmetic, reasoning about arrays, and several other
cvc4: built-in theories. Input problems are written in SMT-LIB format.
cvc4:
