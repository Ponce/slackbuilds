glpk - GNU Linear Programming Kit

The GLPK package is intended for solving large-scale linear programming
(LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other related problems.
It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and organized in the form of a
callable library.

GLPK supports the GNU MathProg language, which is a subset of the AMPL
language.

The GLPK package includes the following main components:

    * primal and dual simplex methods
    * primal-dual interior-point method
    * branch-and-cut method
    * translator for GNU MathProg
    * application program interface (API)
    * stand-alone LP/MIP solver

glpk is an optional dependency for the octave package.
