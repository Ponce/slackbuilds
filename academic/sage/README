Sage is a free open-source mathematics software system licensed under 
the GPL. It combines the power of many existing open-source packages 
into a common Python-based interface. 
Mission: Creating a viable free open source alternative to Magma,
 Maple, Mathematica and Matlab. 

Sage can be used in several ways: through an interactive command line, 
by writing stand-alone scripts, through the graphical notebook 
interface in a browser, or through the KDE Cantor application (part
of a full Slackware installation).

Building sage requires >12GB of disk space, so you may need to
redefine $TMP and/or $OUTPUT.

See README.BUILDOPTS for additional (important) information about
build options and such.

NOTE:
If you have ATOM processors, you need to run this command prior building:
export OPENBLAS_CONFIGURE="TARGET=ATOM"
