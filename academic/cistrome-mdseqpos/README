The cistrome refers to "the set of cis-acting targets of a trans-
acting factor on a genome-wide scale, also known as the in vivo
genome-wide location of transcription factor binding-sites or histone
modifications". The term cistrome is a portmanteau of cistron + genome
and was coined by investigators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
and Harvard Medical School.

This is cistrome-mdseqpos (MDSeqPos), part of the Cistrome-
Applications-Harvard project. MDSeqPos depends on the seqLogo R 
script tool. For details visit https://bioconductor.org/
