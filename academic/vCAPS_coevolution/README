vCAPS: (verbose) Coevolution Analysis using Protein Sequences

CAPS is aimed at measuring the coevolution between amino acid sites
belonging to the same protein (intra-molecular coevolution) or to two
functionally or physically interacting proteins (inter-molecular
coevolution). The Software implements an improved method to detect
intra-molecular coevolution as published in Genetics (Fares and Travers,
2006) and also inter-protein coevolution analysis. The improved scoring
of amino acid sites is obtained by maximum likelihood ancestral state
reconstruction along with simulations to assess significance.

In addition, a test which assesses whether two proteins are interacting
is implemented.

NOTE:
This applies an _unofficial_ patch by Petrov et al 2020, to enable more
verbose output of the program, including CAPS generated phylogenetic
trees and p-values of the pairwise results. The produced executable is
called "vCAPS" and can be installed along "caps" from CAPS_coevolution.
Building CAPS from source requires the Bio++ 1.9 suite.
