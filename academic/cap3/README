CAP3: A DNA sequence assembly program.

CAP3 if the third generation of the CAP sequence assembly program. The
program has a capability to clip 5' and 3' low-quality regions
of reads.  It uses base quality values in computation of overlaps
between reads, construction of multiple sequence alignments of
reads, and generation of consensus sequences. The program also uses
forward-reverse constraints to correct assembly errors and link
contigs.

This just repackages the binaries provided from upstream.
