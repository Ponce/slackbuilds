Scilab is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational
package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.
It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image
enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and
modeling and simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems.
MATLAB code, which is similar in syntax, can be converted to Scilab.
Scilab is one of several open source alternatives to MATLAB.

After installing/upgrading, it is a good idea to logout/login again
to run the updated profile scripts.

If you have issues on upgrading/reinstalling or changing desktop
environments, try delete/rename $HOME/.Scilab to resolve.

zulu-openjdk8, openjdk8 or jdk are optional. Scilab will use the
system-wide installed java if found. Otherwise, scilab will use
its own internal jre.
