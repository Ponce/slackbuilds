CAPS: Coevolution Analysis using Protein Sequences

CAPS is aimed at measuring the coevolution between amino acid sites
belonging to the same protein (intra-molecular coevolution) or to two
functionally or physically interacting proteins (inter-molecular
coevolution). The Software implements an improved method to detect
intra-molecular coevolution as published in Genetics (Fares and Travers,
2006) and also inter-protein coevolution analysis. The improved scoring
of amino acid sites is obtained by maximum likelihood ancestral state
reconstruction along with simulations to assess significance.

In addition, a test which assesses whether two proteins are interacting
is implemented.

NOTE:
The script just repackages the binaries provided from upstream. If you
want to compile the program from source check "vCAPS_coevolution", which
also comes with an unofficial patch that extends the verbosity of the
results.
