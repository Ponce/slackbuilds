Gwyddion is a modular program for SPM (scanning probe microscopy) data
visualization and analysis. Primarily it is intended for analysis of
height fields obtained by means of scanning probe microscopy techniques
(AFM, MFM, STM, SNOM/NSOM), however it can be generally used for any other
height field and image analysis.

libminizip and cfitsio are the optional dependencies.
