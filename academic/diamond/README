DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches,
designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key
features are:

-   Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 500x-20,000x
    speed of BLAST.
-   Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
-   Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard
    desktops or laptops.
-   Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML,
    as well as taxonomic classification.

To now run an alignment task, we assume to have a protein database file
in FASTA format named `nr.faa` and a file of DNA reads that we want to
align named `reads.fna`.

In order to set up a reference database for DIAMOND, the `makedb`
command needs to be executed with the following command line:

    $ diamond makedb --in nr.faa -d nr

This will create a binary DIAMOND database file with the specified name
(`nr.dmnd`). The alignment task may then be initiated using the `blastx`
command like this:

    $ diamond blastx -d nr -q reads.fna -o matches.m8

The output file here is specified with the `–o` option and named
`matches.m8`. By default, it is generated in BLAST tabular format.
