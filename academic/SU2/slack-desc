# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

SU2: SU2 (Open Source CFD Code)
SU2: 
SU2: Open-source suite for Partial Differential Equation (PDE) analysis and
SU2: PDE-constrained optimization problems. Designed with Computational
SU2: Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and aerodynamic shape optimization in mind, but
SU2: extensible to arbitrary sets of governing equations such as potential
SU2: flow, elasticity, electrodynamics, chemically-reacting flows, and many
SU2: others. Under active development by individuals all around the world
SU2: on GitHub and is released under an open-source license.
