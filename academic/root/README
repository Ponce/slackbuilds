ROOT - A data analysis framework.

ROOT provides a set of frameworks with the functionality needed to
handle and analyze large amounts of data in an efficient way. It
includes specialized storage methods such as histograms, curve
fitting, function evaluation, minimization, graphics, visualization
classes; the C++ interpreter cling for fast prototyping; and powerful
parallel processing support.

It comes with a lot of different options for compilation. And it
seems impossible to stress all of them in this one script. Therefore
the potential user is strongly advised to check the cmake command
arguments.

Compilation takes quite a while, thus consider to build ROOT like that:
# MAKEFLAGS=-j5 ./root.SlackBuild

REQUIREMENTS: gl2ps libAfterImage numpy3 tbb ftgl

NOTE: ROOT's python TMVA requires numpy3 built over blas.
