papi (Performance Application Programming Interface)

PAPI provides the tool designer and application engineer with a
consistent interface and methodology for use of the performance
counter hardware found in most major microprocessors. PAPI enables
software engineers to see, in near real time, the relation between
software performance and processor events.

In addition, PAPI provides access to a collection of components that
expose performance measurement opportunites across the hardware and
software stack.
