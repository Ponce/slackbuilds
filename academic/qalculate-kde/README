Qalculate! is a multi-purpose desktop calculator for GNU/Linux. It is small 
and simple to use but with much power and versatility underneath. Features 
include customizable functions, units, arbitrary precision, plotting, and a 
user-friendly interface (KDE or GTK+).

Requires CLN and libqalculate, both of which are available from SlackBuilds.org
