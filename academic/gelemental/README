gElemental is a periodic table viewer that provides detailed info
on the chemical elements. It is a port of GPeriodic to C++ and gtkmm.
It offers an improved UI, an updated and corrected data set, a better
data format, a list view and easier coloration. The Chemical data are
largely derived from BODR (the Blue Obelisk Data Repository) and from
the chemical data compilations on the English Wikipedia.

This requires glibmm and gtkmm.
