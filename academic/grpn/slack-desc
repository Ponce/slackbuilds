# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

grpn: GRPN (graphical reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator)
grpn:
grpn: GRPN is written in C and uses the GIMP Toolkit (GTK) on top of X11.
grpn: GRPN was developed under Linux but has also been tested under SunOS
grpn: and Solaris. It should work with almost any UNIX, though.
grpn: GRPN works with real numbers and complex numbers. Numbers can be
grpn: displayed in 4 different radix modes, and complex numbers can be
grpn: displayed in either Cartesian or polar form. GRPN uses a stack and
grpn: reverse polish notation to evaluate expressions. The stack in GRPN is
grpn: infinite and limited only by available memory.
