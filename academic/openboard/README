OpenBoard is an open source cross-platform teaching software for
interactive whiteboard designed primarily for use in schools and
universities. It can be used both with interactive whiteboards or
in a dual-screen setup with a pen-tablet display and a beamer.

NOTE: Support for Qt6 is available upstream but not yet tested
by maintainer.
