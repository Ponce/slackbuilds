LalnView is a graphical program for visualizing local alignments 
between two sequences (protein or nucleic acids). Sequences are 
represented by colored rectangles to give an overall picture of the 
similarities between the two sequences. Blocks of similarity between 
the two sequences are colored according to the degree of identity 
between segments.
