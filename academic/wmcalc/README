wmcalc is a program designed to act as a simple four-function calculator.  It is different from other
calculator programs, however in that it is designed to take up very little desktop space.  As such, it 
can be left running on the desktop at all times.

Note: The coding of this DockApp seems incredibly unorganized and there are several xpm's that are
almost the same thing. It also seems that for whatever reason the author uses a xpm with the default
WM backdrop, meaning it wont fit in with themed desktops. I may have a patch in the future that fixes 
this and also make it use "wmcalc1.xpm". For now, enjoy it for what it is, a simple WindowMaker 
calculator.
