The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC)

BOINC is an open source middleware system for volunteer and grid
computing.  It was originally developed to support the SETI@home
project before it became useful as a platform for other distributed
applications in areas as diverse as mathematics, medicine, molecular
biology, climatology, and astrophysics. The intent of BOINC is to make
it possible for researchers to tap into the enormous processing power
of personal computers around the world.

Use the idle time on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) to cure
diseases, study global warming, discover pulsars, and do many other
types of scientific research. It's safe, secure, and easy.

Building

(1) Edit DATADIR in the script or run

  DATADIR="/home/<user>/.boinc_data" ./boinc.SlackBuild

to set the data directory in your user's home, or prefered data path,
and build the package.  The default data path is /var/lib/boinc_data.

(2) If you do not wish to build the boincmgr GUI,

  BOINCMGR=no ./boinc.SlackBuild

then you do not need to install the dependencies (wxWidgets).  See
README.Slackware for details on headless configuration.

After installation you need to join a BOINC project:
  http://boinc.berkeley.edu/projects.php

You can then connect the BOINC to the project of your choice.  You can
also use:
  http://boincstats.com/
to set up, organize, and track multiple projects.

To start the BOINC GUI, run:
   boincgui.sh
or
   boincmgr --clientdir=/usr/bin --datadir="/home/<user>/.boinc_data"
