AmplifX: Manage, test and design your primers for PCR.

The main purpose of AmplifX is to seek in a collection of primers,
such as any molecular biologist get in his refrigerators, those which
can be use to amplify a fragment into a target sequence, for example,
and particularly, to design strategies to screen recombinant clones by
PCR. Main features:

Manage your primers
- Import or easily create primer lists
- Name,comment, sort primers
- Share simply primer lists (automatic lockout in read only mode of
  files yet opened by an other user)
- Automatic calculation of quality score (TM [Santa-Lucia method],
  length, GC%, autodimer, complexity, etc.)
- Works with degenerate sequences

Test your primers
- Localise your primers on target sequences (main file formats
  supported and "intelligent" copy-paste)
- Prediction of amplified sequences
- Interactive graphic map
- Pertinent informations on matches and amplicons (TM, size, predicted
  dimers, etc.)

Design your primers
- Simple and intuitive interface to design new primers for amplifying
  a fragment choosing the amplicon size and/or the position
- Many of design options

NOTE:
This is just repackaging of the ready binary for x86 and will not run
on x86_64. It will probably work fine on a Slackware multilib box.
