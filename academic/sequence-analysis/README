A collage of coding projects for biologic sequences analysis.

The upper window panel can hold several sequences, which are both
editable and selectable. The tabs in the lower analysis panel try to
keep up with the current sequence selection to provide immediate
feedback. The selection is used in some modules as only the portion
being analyzed for other modules i.e. Digest is used to determine if
enzymes cut in the in or outside of the selection.

Most commonly available sequence formats have been reverse engineered.
You can also access a sequences from the NCBI via its GID or UID. This
currently cannot be done from behind a firewall.

Most of the analyses are simple enough that they are obvious to use,
Composition, pI. Others could stand some documenation i.e. Pairwise
and Primer Design. The Publish tab uses a string to control the
layout. Click on the Legend button for some help.
