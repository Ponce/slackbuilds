CBLAS is a collection of wrappers that provide a C interface to the FORTRAN
BLAS library.  The interface can be consulted by opening /usr/include/cblas.h

This package is intended for use with the Netlib reference BLAS.  It should
also work with other BLAS implementations that do not already provide a CBLAS
implementation.
