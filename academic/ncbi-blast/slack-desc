# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ncbi-blast: The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of
ncbi-blast: local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide
ncbi-blast: or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the
ncbi-blast: statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer
ncbi-blast: functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well
ncbi-blast: as help identify members of gene families.
