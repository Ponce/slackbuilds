BLAST+ Command Line Applications

The NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of
local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or
protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical
significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and
evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify
members of gene families.

BLAST+ is a new suite of BLAST tools that utilizes the NCBI C++
Toolkit. The BLAST+ applications have a number of performance and
feature improvements over the legacy BLAST applications (ncbi-blast).

For details and citation, please see the BLAST+ user manual from the
program's web site and the article in BMC Bioinformatics. 

This just repackages the binaries provided from upstream.

NOTE ABOUT x86:
Since version 2.2.31, NCBI does not provide 32-bit executables of
BLAST+ for Linux. Their reasoning is that the limited memory and
processing power of 32-bit systems is not suitable for the large
databases searched by BLAST.
