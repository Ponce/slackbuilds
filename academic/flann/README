FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches 
in high dimensional spaces.  It contains a collection of algorithms we found 
to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically 
choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset. 

FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: 
C, MATLAB and Python.  The Python bindings will need numpy, and the MATLAB 
bindings will need MATLAB installed and with its binaries directory set into 
the PATH.  If you want to build the MATLAB bindings, set the environment 
variable WITH_MATLAB to 1.
