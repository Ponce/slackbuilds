# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

flann: nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a
flann: collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor
flann: search and a system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and
flann: optimum parameters depending on the dataset.
