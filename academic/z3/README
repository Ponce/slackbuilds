Z3 is an automated theorem prover and satisfiability modulo theories
(SMT) solver. Given a formula in first-order logic, it attempts
to either prove the formula or find a counterexample. Z3 supports
arithmetic, reasoning about arrays, and several other built-in
theories. Input problems are written in SMT-LIB format.

This package includes the z3 program as well as the C++ and
Python3 APIs.

Optional build arguments:
JAVA=yes: build Java bindings (requires zulu-openjdk21 or similar)
