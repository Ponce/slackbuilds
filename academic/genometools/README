GenomeTools: efficient processing of structured genome annotations

The GenomeTools genome analysis system is a free collection of bio-
informatics tools (in the realm of genome informatics) for biological
sequence analysis and presentation combined into a single binary named
"gt". It is based on a C library named "libgenometools" which consists
of several modules.

GenomeTools can be used for:
- sequence and annotation handling
- sequence compression
- index structure generation and access
- annotation visualization
- ...and much more!
