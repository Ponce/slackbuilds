XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic
isolated airfoils. It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines
which perform various useful functions, such as viscous (or inviscid)
analysis of an existing airfoil, airfoil design and redesign by
interactive modification of surface speed distributions or geometric
parameters, blending of airfoils, writing and reading of airfoil
coordinates and polar save files, and plotting of geometry, pressure
distributions, and multiple polars.
