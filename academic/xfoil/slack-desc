# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xfoil: xfoil (interactive program for design and analysis of airfoils)
xfoil:
xfoil: XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of
xfoil: subsonic isolated airfoils. It consists of a collection of
xfoil: menu-driven routines which perform various useful functions, such as
xfoil: viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil, design and
xfoil: redesign by interactive modification of surface speed distributions
xfoil: or geometric parameters, blending airfoils, plotting, saving, and
xfoil: reading geometry and polars.
