Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is an efficient program that aligns
relatively short nucleotide sequences against a long reference
sequence such as the human genome. It implements two algorithms, bwa-
short and BWA-SW. The former works for query sequences shorter than
200bp and the latter for longer sequences up to around 100kbp. Both
algorithms do gapped alignment. They are usually more accurate and
faster on queries with low error rates.
