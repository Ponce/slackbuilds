Python interface to the R language.

rpy2 is running an embedded R, providing access to it
from Python using R's own C-API through either:

1) a high-level interface making R functions and objects
just like Python functions and providing a seamless
conversion to numpy and pandas data structures

2) a low-level interface closer to the C-API

It is also providing features for when working with
jupyter notebooks or ipython.

NOTE:
R needs to be compiled with the shared library flag,
thus: build R on SBo with R_SHLIB=yes and BLAS_SHLIB=yes
