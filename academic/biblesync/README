biblesync (a bible software shared navigation protocol library)

BibleSync is a shared navigation protocol using LAN multicast.
It is useful for a single person when running Bible programs on
multiple machines or devices, all of which you wish to navigate
through the Bible together, or for a group working closely together,
such as translators. Also, it has a "lecture" mode, where a speaker's 
Bible program induces the audience's programs to follow along.

Some History.
Up until and including xiphos 4.0.0 biblesync was included as part of
the xiphos source code. It has been removed from the source in xiphos 4.0.1
and set to be a general library for any bible software that wants to use
shared navigation. It doesn't have it's own web site yet, so is on the
gnomesword source site. 
biblesync is a requirement for xiphos 4.0.1 or higher.
