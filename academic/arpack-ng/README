ARPACK-NG is a collection of Fortran77 subroutines designed to solve
large scale eigenvalue problems.

This is a fork of ARPACK that is actively maintained.  As such, this
package will conflict with the ARPACK package.  Do not install both.

This requires a BLAS/LAPACK implementation.  Choose one of these package sets:
* OpenBLAS (includes a LAPACK implementation)
* atlas, lapack-atlas
* blas, lapack (the Netlib reference implementations)
If more than one set is installed (assuming there are no packaging conflicts)
then the auto-detection will use the first implementation from this list that
it finds.  If in doubt, choose the Netlib reference implementations; other
packages that require a BLAS or LAPACK implementation may not build if they
are not configured to detect/use alternate implementations.

If the `make check` command fails, try switching to the Netlib reference
implementations, or comment out that command at your own risk.
