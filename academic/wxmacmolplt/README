The MacMolPlt molecular visualization program

MacMolPlt is designed to display the input and output of the GAMESS(US) 
and patched to support PCGAMESS/Firefly quantum chemistry packages.
It produces animations and/or publication quality output from a variety
of input file formats.

It can be built with wxGTK3 instead of wxPython.
