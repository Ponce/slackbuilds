The MacMolPlt molecular visualization program

MacMolPlt is designed to display the input and output of the GAMESS(US) 
and PCGAMESS quantum chemistry packages.  It produces animations and/or 
publication quality output from a variety of input file formats.

This requires wxGTK built with OpenGL support and ming.
