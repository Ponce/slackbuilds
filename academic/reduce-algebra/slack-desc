# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

reduce-algebra: reduce-algebra (A portable general-purpose computer algebra system)
reduce-algebra:
reduce-algebra: REDUCE is an interactive system for general algebraic computations of
reduce-algebra: interest to mathematicians, scientists and engineers.  It can be used
reduce-algebra: interactively for simple calculations but also provides a flexible and
reduce-algebra: expressive user programming language.  REDUCE primarily runs on either
reduce-algebra: Portable Standard Lisp (PSL) or Codemist Standard Lisp (CSL), both of
reduce-algebra: which are included in the SourceForge distribution.  By modern
reduce-algebra: standards, REDUCE is a surprisingly small and compact application.
