# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

paml: paml (PAML: Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood)
paml:
paml: PAML is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or
paml: protein sequences using maximum likelihood. PAML is not good for
paml: tree making. It may be used to estimate parameters and test
paml: hypotheses to study the evolutionary process, when you have
paml: reconstructed trees using other programs such as PAUP*, PHYLIP,
paml: MOLPHY, PhyML, RaxML, etc.
