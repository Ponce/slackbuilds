# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

amplicon: amplicon (Design PCR primers on aligned sequences)
amplicon:
amplicon: Amplicon is a tool for designing PCR primers where groups of related
amplicon: DNA sequences can be assessed in aligned form. This is especially
amplicon: useful for designing 'group-specific' PCR primer sets that produce
amplicon: amplicons from a targer group of species, but not from other groups
amplicon: of species.
