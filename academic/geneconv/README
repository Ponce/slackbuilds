GENECONV: Statistical Tests for Detecting Gene Conversion

Gene conversion is any process that causes a segment of DNA to be
copied onto another segment of DNA, or else appears to act in this
way. The target segment can be on the same chromosome, on a different
chromosome, or in a different organism. Short-segment gene conversion
is an important force in evolution, and often takes place at a higher
frequency than does point mutation.

Given an alignment of DNA or protein sequences, GENECONV finds the
most likely candidates for aligned gene conversion events between
pairs of sequences in the alignment. The program can also look for
gene conversion events from outside of the alignment. Candidate events
are ranked by multiple-comparison corrected P-values and listed to a
spreadsheet-like output file.

IMPORTANT:
You may get a "Segmentation fault" when running the program; the
problem arises only when GENECONV writes to its log file (e.g.
myfile.nex.sum), as opposed to its main output file myfile.nex.frags; 
the easiest workaround is to run GENECONV with the -nolog option:

geneconv myfile.nex -nolog

The program GENECONV is free for academic use, but commercial rights are
reserved. The program may be freely distributed for academic use, as
long as it is not altered or renamed.
