OpenVSP is a parametric aircraft geometry tool.  OpenVSP allows the
user to create a 3D model of an aircraft defined by common engineering
parameters.  This model can be processed into formats suitable for
engineering analysis.

The predecessors to OpenVSP have been developed by J.R. Gloudemans and
others for NASA since the early 1990's.  On January 10 2012, OpenVSP
was released as an open source project under the NASA Open Source
Agreement (NOSA) version 1.3.

You can download sample aircraft at http://hangar.openvsp.org.

Requires fltk from Slackware's /extra folder.

NOTE: OpenVSP version 3.35.3 is the last version that will build on
Slackware 15.0 as newer versions require a newer version of cmake.
