# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cistrome-MACS:
cistrome-MACS: Next generation parallel sequencing technologies made chromatin
cistrome-MACS: immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) a popular
cistrome-MACS: strategy to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions, while
cistrome-MACS: creating challenges for analysis algorithms. We present Model-
cistrome-MACS: based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) on short reads sequencers such
