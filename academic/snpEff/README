SnpEff: Genetic variant annotation and effect prediction toolbox

SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It
annotates and predicts the effects of variants on genes (such as amino
acid changes).

Input: The inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions
and MNPs). The input file is usually obtained as a result of a
sequencing experiment, and it is usually in variant call format (VCF).

Output: SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates the variants
and calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino
acid changes).

This also installs SnpSift, a toolbox that allows you to filter and
manipulate annotated files. Once your genomic variants have been
annotated, you need to filter them out in order to find the 
"interesting / relevant variants". Given the large data files, this is
not a trivial task (e.g. you cannot load all the variants into XLS
spreadsheet). SnpSift helps to perform this VCF file manipulation and
filtering required at this stage in data processing pipelines.
