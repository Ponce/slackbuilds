A real-time space simulation that lets you experience our universe
in three dimensions.

There are four frontend possibilities to choose. The Glut one works out 
of the box, the GTK one needs gtkglext, and the Gnome one is untested.
The KDE frontend hasn't been updated since kde3 times, so it's practically
non-functional.

Since the GTK frontend is the default, gtkglext is a required dependency.
Further, lua53 is listed as required dependency, but lua or lua52 will
work as well.
