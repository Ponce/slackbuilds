The pyCRAC package is a collection of python2-scripts to analyse high
throughput data generated by RNA-sequencing, especially of molecules
crosslinked by UV to an immunoprecipitated protein of interest (i.e.
data generated by CLIP or CRAC protocols).
It can be used to remove duplicate reads,tackles directional libraries
and reports sense and anti-sense hits.

Included is the pipeline used for the analysis of a group of CRAC data
sets.

An R-function used for kinetic CRAC analysis can be found in
/usr/share/pyCRAC/kinetic_crac_pipeline
