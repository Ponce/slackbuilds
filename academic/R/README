R is a language and environment for statistical computing and
graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and
environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T,
now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be
considered as a different implementation of S. There are some
important differences, but much code written for S runs unaltered
under R.

Notes:

If you do not need to build the R shared library (which is needed if
you would like to call R functions from other applications), execute
the script as R_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild

If you do not need to build the BLAS shared library (which is useful
for swapping default unaccelerated BLAS for an accelerated one),
execute the script as BLAS_SHLIB=no ./R.SlackBuild

This package builds R from source; example build time (Intel Core
i7-7500U) is < 10 minutes.
