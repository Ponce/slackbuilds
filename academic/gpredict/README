Gpredict is a real-time satellite tracking and orbit prediction 
application. It can track an unlimited number of satellites and 
display their position and other data in lists, tables, maps, and 
polar plots (radar view). Gpredict can also predict the time of 
future.

Gpredict is different from other satellite tracking programs 
in that it allows you to group the satellites into visualisation 
modules. Each of these modules can be configured independently 
from the others giving you unlimited flexibility concerning the 
look and feel of the modules. Naturally, Gpredict will also 
allow you to track satellites relatively to different observer 
locations - at the same time.
