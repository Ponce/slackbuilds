Xyce is an open source, SPICE-compatible, high-performance analog circuit
simulator, capable of solving extremely large circuit problems by supporting
large-scale parallel computing platforms. It also supports serial execution on
all common desktop platforms, and small-scale parallel runs on Unix-like
systems. In addition to analog electronic simulation, Xyce has also been used
to investigate more general network systems, such as neural networks and power
grids.

The Xyce Parallel Electronic Simulator is a SPICE-compatible circuit simulator,
developed internally at Sandia National Laboratories and funded by the National
Nuclear Security Administration's Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC)
Campaign. In continuous development since 1999, Xyce is designed to run on
large-scale parallel computing platforms, though it also executes efficiently on
a variety of architectures, including single processor workstations. As a mature
platform for large-scale parallel circuit simulation, Xyce supports standard
capabilities available from commercial simulators, in addition to a variety of
devices and models specific to Sandia's needs.

The package is intalled at: /opt/Xyce
Remember to set the library and path:

PATH=$PATH:/opt/Xyce/bin

For 32-bit:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/Xyce/lib

For 64-bit:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/Xyce/lib64

To run the suite test:
# cd /opt/Xyce/Xyce_Regression-6.3/TestScripts
# ./run_xyce_regression

For parallel simulation trilinos must be compiled with MPI.

Additonal requirements:
 - MPI (openmpi/mpich)
 - parMETIS
