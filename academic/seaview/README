SeaView is a multiplatform, graphical user interface for multiple
sequence alignment and molecular phylogeny. Important features are:

1) SeaView reads and writes various file formats (NEXUS, MSF, CLUSTAL,
   FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE, Newick) of DNA and protein sequences and of
   phylogenetic trees.

2) SeaView drives programs muscle or Clustal Omega (clustalo) for
   multiple sequence alignment, and also allows to use any external
   alignment algorithm able to read and write FASTA-formatted files.

3) Seaview drives the Gblocks program to select blocks of
   evolutionarily conserved sites.

4) SeaView computes phylogenetic trees by
	a) parsimony, using PHYLIP's dnapars/protpars algorithm
	b) distance, with NJ or BioNJ algorithms on a variety of
	   evolutionary distances,
	c) maximum likelihood, driving program PhyML 3.1.

5) SeaView prints and draws phylogenetic trees on screen, SVG, PDF or
   PostScript files. 
   
6) SeaView allows to download sequences from EMBL/GenBank/UniProt
   using the Internet.
