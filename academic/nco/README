NCO (netCDF Operators Software Stack)

The NCO toolkit manipulates and analyzes data stored in netCDF-
accessible formats, including DAP, HDF4, and HDF5. It exploits the
geophysical expressivity of many CF (Climate & Forecast) metadata
conventions, the flexible description of physical dimensions translated
by UDUnits, the network transparency of OPeNDAP, the storage features
(e.g., compression, chunking, groups) of HDF (the Hierarchical Data
Format), and many powerful mathematical and statistical algorithms of
GSL (the GNU Scientific Library).
