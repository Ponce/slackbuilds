STAR aligns short and long RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using
uncompressed suffix arrays, resulting in fast, accurate mapping.
STAR is capable of unbiased de novo detection of canonical splice
junctions, can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
transcripts and can map full-length RNA sequences. Comes with
STARsolo for: mapping, demultiplexing and gene quantification for
single cell RNA-seq (See STARmanual).

The make command for building the program assumes that the cpu is
supporting AVX extensions, included in intel processors since Sandy
Bridge (2008) and in AMD cpus since Bulldozer (2011). See the
Slackbuild if other processors can be supported.

LIMITATIONS
This release was tested with the default parameters for human and
mouse genomes. Mammal genomes require at least 16GB of RAM, ideally
32GB. Please contact the author for a list of recommended parameters
for much larger or much smaller genomes.
