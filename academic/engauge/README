Engauge digitizing software converts an image file showing a graph or map, 
into numbers. The image file can come from a scanner, digital camera or 
screenshot. The numbers can be read on the screen, and written or copied 
to a spreadsheet. Engauge Digitizer compensates for rotation, scaling 
and skew (also known as shearing) in graphs. Engauge recognizes BMP, GIF,
JPG, PNG, PNM, and XPM bitmaps.

This requires qt3.
