SPAdes: a single-cell genome assembler

SPAdes (St. Petersburg genome assembler) is intended for both standard
isolates and single-cell MDA bacteria assemblies.

SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about
genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be
obtained via traditional metagenomics studies.
