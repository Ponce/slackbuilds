The Gnome Chemistry Utils (gchemutils) is a collection of libraries,
programs and plugins that are useful for chemists and science students.

Six programs are available:
1) A 2D chemical editor (GChemPaint)
2) A 3D molecular structure viewer (GChem3Viewer)
3) A Crystal structure viewer (GCrystal)
4) A Chemical calculator (GChemCalc)
5) A Spectrum viewer (GSpectrum)
6) A periodic table of the elements application (GChemTable)

A GOffice plugin is included, which allows embedding GChemPaint
supported files in programs supporting the GOffice component
framework.

Note: previously, there were also plugins for Mozilla and Gnumeric.
These have been removed because they no longer build with modern
versions of Mozilla and Gnumeric.
