CDO (Climate Data Operators)

CDO is a collection of command line Operators to manipulate and analyse
Climate and NWP model Data.

Supported data formats are GRIB 1/2, netCDF 3/4, SERVICE, EXTRA and
IEG. There are more than 600 operators available.

By default, the script does not build nor run the tests. You can use the
option TESTBUILD=YES to build and run the tests before the make install
part.  Note that the hdf5 slackbuild builds the library in a
non-thread-safe manner so one of the test will fail with a note in the
test log about requiring the use of the -L flag to compensate, but the
tests themself to not use that flag so fails.
