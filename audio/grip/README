grip2 (graphical CD player and ripper)

Grip is a gtk-based cd-player and cd-ripper. It has the ripping
capabilities of cdparanoia builtin, but can also use external rippers
(such as cdda2wav).

Optional runtime dependency: yelp. If this is installed, grip's Help
will be displayed with it. Otherwise, the Help will be displayed in
your default web browser.
