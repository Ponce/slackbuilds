pianobar is a console client for the personalized web radio pandora
(http://www.pandora.com).

- play and manage (create, add more music, delete, rename, ...) your stations
- rate played songs and let pandora explain why they have been selected
- show upcoming songs/song history
- configure keybindings and text output
- remote control and eventcmd interface (send tracks to last.fm, for example)
- proxy support for listeners outside the USA

Included with this SlackBuild is a helper script called pianobarctl that 
allows the user to remotely control some pianobar functions.  To use 
this a FIFO must first be created by the user:
   mkfifo ~/.config/pianobar/ctl

Please see man pianobar and pianobarctl --help for more information.

NOTE:
Around the end of last year Pandora changed their certificate, so pianobar
will not work unless you give it the new fingerprint.

In your pianobar config file (~/.config/pianobar/config) you need to have
the following line:
     tls_fingerprint = 13CC51AC0C31CD96C55015C76914360F7AC41A00

(By the way, an example config file is in /usr/doc/pianobar-$VERSION/)

The next time Pandora updates their cert again, you can quickly find the
value needed by executing:
     sh /usr/doc/pianobar-$VERSION/example-scripts/tls_fingerprint.sh
