japa (audio spectrum analyser for jack)

Japa (JACK and ALSA Perceptual Analyser), is a 'perceptual' or
'psychoacoustic' audio spectrum analyser. In contrast to JAAA,
this is more an acoustical or musical tool than a purely technical
one. Possible uses include spectrum monitoring while mixing or
mastering, evaluation of ambient noise, and (using pink noise),
equalisation of PA systems.

By default, the package is built with '-march=native'. If you need a
generic package that can be installed on any Slackware machine with the
same ARCH as the build host, set FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the script's
environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
