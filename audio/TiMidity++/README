TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer.  It can play MIDI files by
converting them into PCM waveform data or other various audio file
formats.

TiMidity++ can also be run as an ALSA sequencer client.  To do
this, make /etc/rc.d/rc.timidity executable and add this line to
/etc/rc.d/rc.local:

    /etc/rc.d/rc.timidity start

Optional dependencies are jack, speex, and portaudio.

You will need a set of instrument patch files or soundbank fonts
for TiMidity++ to be of any use.  Install freepats, eawpats,
or fluid-soundfont (or any combination of these) to satisfy this
dependency.
