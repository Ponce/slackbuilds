Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs.  It is highly
programmable, supports a variety of audio and sample file formats,
includes a complete implementation of Common Lisp Music (CLM), can be
run sans GUI as a scripting engine, and more.

This SlackBuild configures Snd to use Scheme (s7), ALSA, and Motif, as
these options are well-supported by Snd's author and extensively
tested.

Support for OpenGL rendering of spectrograms can be enabled like so:
  OPENGL=yes sh ./snd.SlackBuild
This is not appropriate for all configurations, so this option is
disabled by default.
