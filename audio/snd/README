Snd is a sound editor modelled loosely after Emacs.  It is highly
programmable, supports a variety of audio and sample file formats,
includes a complete implementation of Common Lisp Music (CLM), can be
run sans GUI as a scripting engine, and more.

This SlackBuild configures Snd to use Scheme (s7), ALSA, and Motif, as
these are currently the best supported (and tested) options for Snd.
Slackare 14.2 includes Motif and the GNU Scientific Library (gsl), so
these dependencies can now be the preferred defaults for Snd.

OpenGL rendering of spectrograms under Motif can also enabled by
passing "--with-gl" to configure in snd.SlackBuild.
