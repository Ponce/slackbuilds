# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

jack-keyboard: jack-keyboard is a virtual MIDI keyboard - a program that allows
jack-keyboard: you to send JACK MIDI events (play ;-) using your PC keyboard. It's
jack-keyboard: somewhat similar to vkeybd, except it uses JACK MIDI instead of ALSA,
jack-keyboard: and the default keyboard mapping is much better - it uses the same
jack-keyboard: layout as trackers (like Impulse Tracker) did, so you have two and
jack-keyboard: half octaves under your fingers.
