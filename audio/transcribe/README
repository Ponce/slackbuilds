The Transcribe! application is an assistant for people who sometimes want
to work out a piece of music from a recording, in order to write it out,
or play it themselves, or both. It doesn't do the transcribing for you,
but it is essentially a specialised player program which is optimised
for the purpose of transcription. It has many transcription-specific
features not found on conventional music players.

Transcribe! is proprietary software. After installation, Transcribe! will
be fully functional for a 30-day evaluation period. To buy the software,
use the site at http://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/buy.html. The
Slackware package doesn't need to be changed or updated (just enter the
license key).
