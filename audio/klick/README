klick (metronome for jack-audio-connection-kit)

klick is an advanced command-line based metronome for JACK. It allows
you to define complex tempo maps for entire songs or performances.

Note:

this package is built with liblo support. It allows klick to be
controlled by other OSC-capable applications. You can disable
with LIBLO=no in the script's environment. If you plan to use gtklick,
it requires klick built with liblo support.

Optional dependencies:

rubberband - uses the RubberBand library for pitch adjustment, which
results in slightly higher audio quality. Disabled by default; enable
with RUBBERBAND=yes in the script's environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
