# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

mp3gain: MP3Gain does not just do peak normalization, as many normalizers
mp3gain: do. Instead, it does some statistical analysis to determine how loud
mp3gain: the file actually sounds to the human ear. Also, the changes MP3Gain
mp3gain: makes are completely lossless. There is no quality lost in the change
mp3gain: because the program adjusts the mp3 file directly, without decoding
mp3gain: and re-encoding.
