pulseaudio is a networked sound server for Unix-like operating systems
and Microsoft Windows. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement 
for the Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESOUND).

Optional deps: sbc, jack-audio-connection-kit, avahi, lirc, libasyncns, orc

Bluetooth support requires the optional sbc package (in addition to the
standard bluez package).

USAGE:
In almost all cases, pulseaudio should be run as a normal user daemon
i.e. NOT a system wide daemon. It will be usually started by the desktop
environment (KDE, XFCE, MATE) when the user logs in. In general, there is
nothing more the user needs to do (configuration for particular devices or
circumstances notwithstanding).

If necessary, pulseaudio may be started manually with:
	/usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11

In the EXTREMELY RARE case that pulseaudio needs to run as a system wide
daemon, the /etc/rc.d/rc.pulseaudio script is provided. It is not used at all
in the usual case, as above, in which pulseaudio runs as a normal user daemon.
Additionally, in the system wide daemon mode only, pulseaudio will need a
pulse group/user to run as. This may be done with:
	groupadd -g 216 pulse
	useradd -u 216 -g pulse -d /var/run/pulse -m pulse
