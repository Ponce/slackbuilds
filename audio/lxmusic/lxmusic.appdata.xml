  <description>
    <p>LXMusic is the minimalist music player for LXDE. It is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the audio player xmms2, which is lightweight and incorporates a server/client design. LXMusic is simple to operate: the user can build multiple playlists of audio files (and xmms2-supported audio streams), and LXMusic plays a selected playlist. A wide variety of audio formats can be played by LXMusic by installing the appropriate xmms2 plugins.</p>
