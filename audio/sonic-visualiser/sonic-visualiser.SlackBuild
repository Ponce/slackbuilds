# Slackware build script for sonic-visualiser

# Written by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20211207 bkw: update for 4.4.
# - liblo is now a hard dep.
# - jack is a hard dep again.
# - get rid of 10+ year outdated Debian man pages, write an up-to-date one.
#   unfortunately I do not speak French, so the new man page is English-only.
# - upstream switched to meson, can no longer build older versions with
#   this script.

# 20201104 bkw: update for 4.2.
# 20191212 bkw:
# - Update for 4.0.1.
# - New deps: libfishsound capnproto opusfile.
# - Removed JACK as a hard dep.
# - Have slack-desc tell the user what optional deps are built-in.
# - Annoying stuff relating to the test suite.
# - If necessary, source the qt5 profile script.
# - Install French man page.
# - Fix icon reference in .desktop.
# - It looks like the segfault-on-exit problem was caused by an outdated
#   version of qt5. It's gone away with qt5-5.9.8.

# 20181217 bkw:
# - Update for 3.2. This was left stale for a long time due to
#   problems with SBo's old qt5, which has finally been updated,
#   thanks to dive.
# - Get rid of static capnproto, no longer needed (thank the ghods).
# - PulseAudio now works, update README accordingly.
# - Yes, I'm aware that it's segfaulting on exit, but it won't dump
#   core (even though I have coredumps enabled) so I can't easily
#   diagnose it.

# 20170312 bkw:
# - update for 3.0.1
# - parallel build seems OK, remove -j1 (again)
# - 3.0.1 requires a bleeding-edge capnproto (newer than the latest
#   release) so build a static one to link with. When capnproto.SlackBuild
#   gets updated past 0.5.3, this stuff can go away. The static capnproto
#   is used whether or not capnproto is installed on the system, and it's
#   not installed as part of the sonic-visualiser package.
# - add note to README about pulse and portaudio failures. I don't know
#   what's wrong yet, but jack-audio-connection-kit remains a hard dep
#   unless/until I figure it out.
# - upstream fixed the .desktop, remove my code that fixed the old one.
# - stop the unit tests from spamming /root

# 20160819 bkw:
# - parallel build is still broken, revert to -j1

# 20160806 bkw:
# - updated to 2.5, which means adding a qt5 dep.
# - fix parallel build.
# - according to INSTALL.txt, jack-audio-connection-kit is optional,
#   so I was going to remove it from REQUIRES. I tried building without it,
#   but the build failed, so it remains a hard dep for now.

# 20140913 bkw:
# - finally updated (from 1.9 to 2.3)
# - add man page
# - use png icon rather than svg
# - add MIME types for desktop integration
# - add realtime capabilities

# 20211207 bkw: upstream switched from autotools to meson/ninja. Also,
# the test suite is no longer run by default, so all the extra code here
# that was needed to make the tests pass, is gone. And, there's now a
# functional 'install' target.
# According to COMPILE_linux.md, mlton is required. But building without
# it works fine and produces a binary that works fine...
