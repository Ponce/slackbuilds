Take over audio/media system totally by Pipewire this time!

Important Notes:
Blacklist following package to prevent any reconfigure with this
program:

pulseaudio

Or, just don't accept any .NEW configs from pulse while you upgrade by
slackpkg.

In case you want to switch back to pulseaudio, you need to execute this
after installation as superuser:
    # pipe-pulse -d    #--enable-pulse

Same goes with revert back, again:
    # pipe-pulse -e    #--enable-pipewire

You need to reboot or atleast re-login, so changes appear.
