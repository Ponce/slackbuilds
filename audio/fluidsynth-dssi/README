fluidsynth-dssi (DSSI plugin wrapper for FluidSynth)

fluidsynth-dssi is a wrapper for the FluidSynth SoundFont-playing
software synthesizer, allowing it to function as a DSSI plugin.

If you want fluidsynth-dssi to actually make sound, you'll have to
install at least one soundfont (e.g. fluid-soundfont).
