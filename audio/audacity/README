Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds.
With Audacity one can record live audio, convert tapes and records into
digital recordings, edit Ogg, MP3, and WAV sound files, and much more.

Optional dependencies (autodetected) are ffmpeg, jack-audio-connection-kit,
ladspa_sdk, lame, soundtouch, twolame, vamp-plugin-sdk and lilv + suil
(for lv2 support).

The manual is packaged with the application only if you pass the script
the additional option
  MANUAL=yes

NOTE: This won't build if you had previously built and installed wxGTK3
using the command line option STL=yes
