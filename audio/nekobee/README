Nekobee is a DSSI plugin. 

It is a Roland TB-303 (bass synth) clone. It clones 
just the synth part of the 303 (not the sequencer) 
and has a single oscillator and all of 8 knobs. 
It is a mono synth. 

Simple but iconic.

A different iteration of this synth is available in the
distrho-mini-series package (also on SlackBuilds.org).
It's safe to install both.
