shntool is a command-line utility to view and/or modify WAVE data and
properties. It runs in several different operating modes, and supports
various lossless audio formats.

shntool is comprised of three parts - its core, mode modules, and format
modules. This helps to make the code easier to maintain, as well as aid
other programmers in developing new functionality. The distribution
archive contains a file named 'modules.howto' that describes how to
create a new mode or format module, for those so inclined.

If you wish to have shntool support shorten, you should install shorten
(also available from SlackBuilds.org) first.
