lv2dynparam1 (dynamic parameter extension for LV2)

lv2dynparam is a LV2 plugin interface extension that enables plugin
parameters to appear and disappear (i.e. number of voices). It also
allows nested grouping of parameters. Groups can be used for things
like ADSR abstraction, i.e. group of 4 float parameters.

The extension consists of a header describing the extension
interface and libraries, one for plugins and one for hosts, to expose
functionality in a more usable interface, from the programmer's point
of view.
