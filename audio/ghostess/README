ghostess (graphical DSSI host)

Based on jack-dssi-host, capable of saving and restoring plugin
configuration, as well as specifying MIDI channels and layering synths.

ghostess also comes with a universal DSSI GUI, which attempts to provide
GUI services for any DSSI or LADSPA plugin, and may be used with any
DSSI host.

This requires jack-audio-connection-kit, ladspa_sdk and dssi.
