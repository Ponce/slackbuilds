ghostess (graphical DSSI and LADSPA host)

Based on jack-dssi-host, capable of saving and restoring plugin
configuration, as well as specifying MIDI channels and layering synths.

ghostess also comes with a universal DSSI GUI, which attempts to provide
GUI services for any DSSI or LADSPA plugin, and may be used with any
DSSI host.

Note: ghostess does not appear in your desktop environment's start
menu. This is because it requires a command-line argument to select
the plugin to run, so it must be run from a terminal (or e.g. a shell
script).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
