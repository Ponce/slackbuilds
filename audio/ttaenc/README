ttaenc (TTA1 lossless audio encoder/decoder)

TTA performs lossless compression on multichannel 8,16 and 24 bits data of the Wav audio files.
Being "lossless" means that no data-quality is lost in the compression - when uncompressed,
the data will be identical to the original. The compression ratios of TTA depend on the type of
music file being compressed, but the compression size will generally range between 30% - 70% of
the original. TTA format supports both of ID3v1/v2 and APEv2 tags.

This package can coexist with "tta", also available in SlackBuilds.
