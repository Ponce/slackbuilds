flake (open-souce FLAC audio encoder)

Flake is an open-souce FLAC audio encoder.
It was developed as an independent implementation of the FLAC specification,
and is meant to be an alternative to the FLAC reference encoder.
While Flake does not yet have many of the advanced features of the reference encoder, it does have the benefit of faster encoding.

Features:

* Commandline encoder frontend
* libflake library which can be used by other programs
* Fast encoding
* Compression modes which closely mirror the reference encoder, plus additional modes for higher compression
* A variety of LPC order search methods, each of which has its own speed vs. compression tradeoff
* Variable block size encoding: an experimental feature which is allowed as part of the specification,
  but is not currently implemented in the reference encoder.
