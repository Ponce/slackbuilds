.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBflake\fP is an alternative encoder for the Free Lossless Audio Codec. Most tests turn out very similar or slightly better compression than the FLAC reference encoder, and it generally encodes significantly faster. Decoding times of the generated files are also close to those made by the reference encoder.
