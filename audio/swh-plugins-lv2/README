swh-plugins-lv2 (GPL free software audio plugins for LV2)

This collection of plugins by Steve Harris includes the usual effects
such as EQ, compression, flange, phaser, chorus, echo/delay, reverb,
tube amp simulation, etc. 93 plugins are included (too many to list
here).

For LADSPA versions of these plugins, see swh-plugins.

These plugins work in lv2_jack_host and ardour, but do NOT work in
lv2rack (attempting to load them will cause lv2rack to segfault).
