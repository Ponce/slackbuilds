.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
reverbed [\fB\-a\fP | \fB\-i\fP | \fB\-o\fP] [\fB\-c\fP \fIclient_name\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBreverbed\fP, aka TAP Reverb Editor, is a standalone JACK application
that implements a reverb effect, with graphical interface to allow
changing parameters on the fly.
.sp
\fBreverbed\fP creates two JACK inputs and two JACK outputs, which must
be connected to other JACK inputs/outputs in order to route audio
through the application. By default, these aren\(aqt connected to anything
at startup, but see the options below.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-i\fP
Autoconnect JACK inputs to the first two hardware capture ports.
.TP
.B \fB\-o\fP
Autoconnect JACK outputs to the first two hardware playback ports.
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP
Autoconnect both input and output ports (same as \fB\-i\fP \fB\-o\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP \fIclient_name\fP
Use \fBclient_name\fP instead of the default \fIreverbED\fP when
connecting to JACK. You need this option if you want to run more
than one instance of the program at the same time, since JACK
client programs must have unique client names.
