tap (audio plugins for LADSPA)

Tom's Audio Processing plugins is a selection of LADSPA plugins for audio
engineering on the Linux platform. Intended for use in a professional
DAW environment such as Ardour, it includes high quality reverberation,
echo, eq, limiter & more.

This package includes the main tap-plugins distribution, plus the
tap-plugins-doc and tap-reverbed (TAP Reverb Editor) distributions.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
