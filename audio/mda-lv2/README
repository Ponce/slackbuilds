mda-lv2 (instrument and effect plugins)

MDA-LV2 is an LV2 port of the MDA plugins by Paul Kellett. It contains
36 high-quality plugins for a variety of tasks.

This is a more or less faithful port of both the effects and instrument
plugins. The only functional difference in code is to support LV2-style
toggle ports (> 0.0 is on, rather than 0.5). All the plugins have been
tested, and thanks to several bug fixes this collection should be more
reliable than the original.

The instrument plugins make use of the new atom:AtomPort to receive
MIDI. Apologies for any inconvenience, but this means they will only
work in modern hosts which have implemented atom-based MIDI. The
effects should work fine in any LV2 host.

See /usr/doc/mda-lv2-$VERSION/plugins.txt for descriptions of the
plugins.
