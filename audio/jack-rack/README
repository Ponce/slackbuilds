jack-rack (LADSPA effects host)

JACK Rack is an effects "rack" for the JACK low latency audio API. The
rack can be filled with LADSPA effects plugins and can be controlled using
the ALSA sequencer. It's phat; it turns your computer into an effects box.

This requires jack-audio-connection-kit and ladspa_sdk.
Optional build dependency: lash
Optional runtime dependency: ecasound (for /usr/bin/ecarack script)
