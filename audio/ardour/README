Ardour is an application to fit the needs of musicians under Linux.
It is designed to be a fully functional professional audio application,
that uses the professional sound server jack for sound i/o.

If you want ardour with lv2 support pass LV2=yes to the script. This will
additionally need lilv and suil.

Ardour optionally requires cwiid for wiimote support.
