jack-tools (tools for jack)

This collection contains a bunch of small tools for JACK, written by
Rohan Drape.

Included utilities:

rju-data -      JACK audio data onto OSC.
rju-dl -        JACK shared library dsp loader.
rju-osc -       JACK Transport Publication Daemon.
rju-play -      JACK Sound File Player.
rju-plumbing -  JACK Plumbing Daemon.
rju-record -    JACK Capture Client.
rju-scope -     JACK Oscilloscope.
rju-transport - Minimalist JACK Transport Interface.
rju-udp -       JACK UDP Transport Client.

If you have the VST SDK from Steinberg, the package can also include
some VST-related tools:

rju-lxvst -   Linux native VST host. Not included by default.
lxvst-query - Print information about a Linux native VST plugin.

See README_VST.txt for details.

In previous versions of jack-tools, the tool names had "jack-" as a
prefix, instead of "rju-". Upstream changed the names in April, 2021.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
