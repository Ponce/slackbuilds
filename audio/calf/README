Calf audio plugin pack for LADSPA, DSSI, LV2 and JACK. Contains effects
(flanger, reverb, tape-like delay, phaser, rotary speaker, multi-mode
filter, multi-tap chorus and compressor) and instruments (organ simulator
and a monophonic synthesizer).

This requires jack-audio-connection-kit.

Optional dependencies: By default, these are auto-detected at build time.
Support for each dep will be built if found, unless disabled with an
environment variable.

ladspa_sdk: Disable with LADSPA=no (which will also disable DSSI).
dssi: Disable with DSSI=no.
lv2core and slv2: Disable with LV2=no.
lash: cannot be disabled.

Even with all the plugin formats disabled, calfjackhost will still
be built.

To enable some experimental LV2 plugins designed for use with modular
hosts, set EXPERIMENTAL=yes in the environment (default is "no").
