Calf Studio Gear is an audio plug-in pack for LV2 and JACK environments
under Linux operating systems. The suite contains lots of effects (delay,
modulation, signal processing, filters, equalizers, dynamics, distortion
and mastering effects), instruments (SF2 player, organ simulator and
a monophonic synthesizer) and tools (analyzer, mono/stereo tools,
crossovers). Calf Studio Gear aims for a professional audience.

By default, the package is built with SSE support if the host CPU supports
SSE. If building for another host, you can set SSE=yes or SSE=no in the
environment to override the autodetection.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
