# This stuff used to be in the script, but it was getting annoyingly
# long. Probably only of interest to me, and maybe future archaeologists.

# 20180619 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.37.1.
# - Force building with bundled zita-convolver and resampler libs.
#   Previously, system libs would be linked if they were installed,
#   otherwise bundled libs were used... caused a problem if the
#   system zita-convolver was updated to an incompatible version.
# - Add config options to re-enable ladspa and lv2 mod-gui stuff that
#   used to be enabled by default in 0.36.1.
# - Add patches from upstream git, to fix segfaults when online
#   button gets clicked. Also if dbus isn't running, guitarix will now
#   actually say so, in its error message.
# - Move old changelog entries to ChangeLog.old.

# 20171223 bkw: Updated for 0.36.1.
# 20170825 bkw: Updated for 0.35.6. Install the bundled roboto font.
# 20170725 bkw: Updated for 0.35.5

# 20170710 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.35.4
# - Remove README stuff about webkitgtk, since upstream dropped it.
# - Add README.online with troubleshooting info. I had trouble
#   getting the new Online Presets stuff to work, so hopefully this
#   might help the next guy.

# 20170404 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.35.3
# - Use + rather than ; in find/chmod. Noticeably faster.

# 20170306 bkw:
# - Flip changelog comments right-side up
# - Stop writing outside of $TMP.

# 20161016 bkw: Updated for 0.35.2

# 20160806 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.35.1
# - removed WEBKIT=no option from README (it was removed from the
#   script in March, should have been removed from README then).
# - removed webkitgtk from REQUIRES, as it's now optional (and
#   autodetected, no way to force-disable it).
# - removed patches, since they're already included in the new release.
# - remove unimplemented SSE=no option. Note that SSE support is still
#   autodetected, so if someone's trying this on e.g. ARCH=arm, it should
#   automatically build without SSE (I have no idea if the build will
#   actually complete, in that case).
# - remove .desktop sed stuff, upstream fixed it.
# - update man page.
# - note: zita-convolver and zita-resampler are not requirements. they
#   will be linked if installed, otherwise guitarix's bundled copies will
#   be used. I only mention this here so I won't forget again...

# 20160329 dbs:
# - Updated for Slackware-14.2.  Forced -msse in SLKCFLAGS.
#   This just won't build without SSE on 32 bit gcc-5.3.0 :(
#     xmmintrin.h:857:1: error: inlining failed in call to always_inline
#     ‘void _MM_SET_EXCEPTION_STATE(unsigned int)’: target specific option mismatch
#   Patch 0003-fix-build-even-for-gcc4.8.patch doesn't fix it, and there
#   are no further fixes upstream at this time.

# 20151108 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.34.0
# - Added --disable-cxx11 to ./waf flags, as bluetooth.h uses the gcc
#   typeof() extension. Not sure if newer versions of bluez would have
#   this issue (but Slackware 14.1's bluez is pretty old by now).
# - Added patch from upstream git to allow building without webkitgtk.
#   The author added support for downloading presets, but didn't make
#   it optional in 0.34.0. Also added a couple of bugfix patches.
# - Support building 0.33.0 with VERSION=0.33.0 in the env.
# - Add SSE=no option.
# - Add WEBKIT=no option.
# - Remove LV2=no option from README (but not from script).

# 20150514 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.32.3
# - Fix some issues with the shared libs: they were being installed
#   to /usr/lib/ on 64-bit, and they were missing the +x bits.
# - Made LV2 option default to yes, since upstream is requiring lilv
#   even if --no-lv2 is used. Also, the lv2 plugins were being
#   installed to /usr/lib/ on 64-bit. Grr.
# - Upstream wants avahi by default. For now, hardcoded --no-avahi.

# 20130430 bkw:
# - Updated for 0.27.1
# - Replaced slack-desc with updated text from guitarix site
# - Added LV2 option

# 20121216 bkw:
# - Upgraded to guitarix2
# - Added man page
# - Added realtime capabilities
# - Make .desktop file validate
# - Add guitarix's README to /usr/doc
