guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a full-featured
universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp clean-sounds, nice overdrive,
fat distortion and a diversity of crazy sounds never heard before.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

Guitarix can be used as a standalone application, as LADSPA plugins,
or as LV2 plugins. By default, all three are built. To disable LV2, set
LV2=no in the script's environment (you will still need lilv installed,
however). The script author hasn't tested LV2 support.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
