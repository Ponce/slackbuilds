guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a full-featured
universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp clean-sounds, nice overdrive, fat
distortion and a diversity of crazy sounds never heard before. Guitarix
can be used as a standalone application, as LADSPA plugins, or as LV2
plugins.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

By default, the package is built with SSE support if the host CPU supports
SSE. If building for another host, you can set SSE=no in the environment
to build without it.

Starting with version 0.34.0, guitarix can browse and download presets
from the web, using the 'Online' button in the preset selector. To
enable this feature, install webkitgtk before building guitarix. To
disable this feature (even if webkitgtk is installed), set WEBKIT=no in
the environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
