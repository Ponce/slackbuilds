guitarix (virtual guitar amplifier for jack)

guitarix offers the range of sounds you would expect from a
full-featured universal guitar-amp. You can get crisp clean-sounds,
nice overdrive, fat distortion and a diversity of crazy sounds never
heard before. Guitarix can be used as a standalone application, as
LADSPA plugins, or as LV2 plugins.

For 32-bit x86, a CPU with SSE instructions is required. For other
architectures, SSE will be used if available.

meterbridge is an optional runtime dependency.

Starting with version 0.35.4, guitarix's 'Online presets' feature no
longer requires webkitgtk. See README.online for more information.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
