Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that
should be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a
software synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds of
controls for each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his instrument.
First presented at the 2nd LAD conference in Karlsruhe, end of April
2004.

Requires: clthreads, clxclient, clalsadrv, jack-audio-connection-kit,
stops
