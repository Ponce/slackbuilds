jkmeter (audio level meter for JACK)

Jkmeter is a horizontal or vertical bargraph level meter based
on the ideas of mastering guru Bob Katz. See:

https://www.aes.org/technical/documentDownloads.cfm?docID=65

This is the type of meter you want for live recording, mixing and
mastering. It probably makes no sense to use it on all tracks of a
DAW, where keeping digital level within limits is the main purpose of
metering.

By default, the package is built with '-march=native'. If you need a
generic package that can be installed on any Slackware machine with
the same ARCH as the build host, set FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the
script's environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
