jkmeter (audio level meter for JACK)

Jkmeter is a horizontal or vertical bargraph level
meter based on the ideas of mastering guru Bob Katz.  See
<http://www.digido.com/media/articles-and-demos.html> and follow the
links on 'level practices'.

This is the type of meter you want for live recording, mixing and
mastering. It probably makes no sense to use it on all tracks of a DAW,
where keeping digital level within limits is the main purpose of metering.

By default, the package is built with '-march=native'. If you need a
generic package that can be installed on any Slackware machine with the
same ARCH as the build host, set FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the script's
environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
