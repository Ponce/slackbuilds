mhwaveedit (edit, play, and record sound files)

mhWaveEdit is a graphical program for editing, playing, and recording
sound files. It is lightweight, portable, user-friendly, and handles
large files very well.

The program itself has only simple editing features such as cut &
paste and volume adjustment, but it can also use Ladspa effect plugins
and the effects provided by the SoX application. It can also support
additional file formats besides wav through libsndfile and mp3/ogg
import and export through lame and oggenc/oggdec. It can import (but
not save) other file types via mplayer, such as .webm or .m4a, or the
soundtracks to video files.

lame is an optional runtime dependency.

jack is an optional (autodetected) build-time dependency.

Build options (environment):

OSS=yes  - if you need OSS audio support (disabled by default).
PULSE=no - do not include PulseAudio support (included by default).
JACK=no  - do not include jack support (autodetected by default).

ALSA and SDL-1.2 audio support are always included. EsounD and aRts
are autodetected, but currently neither is included in Slackware
or SBo.

If jack support is included, this package uses POSIX filesystem
capabilities to execute with elevated privileges (required
for realtime audio processing). This may be considered a
security/stability risk. Please read http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/
for more information. To disable capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the
script.
