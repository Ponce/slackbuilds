foo-yc20 (Yamaha YC-20 organ emulator for JACK and LV2)

This is an implementation of a 1969 designed Yamaha combo organ,
the YC-20.

Original YC-20 organs have a touch vibrato control, which is vibrato
induced by horizontal movement of the keys. As there are very few
(almost no) MIDI keyboards which produce such information, this
feature has been left out of the emulation. Instead of the touch
vibrato control, the control panel hosts a "realism" switch.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.

Since audio synthesis is compute-intensive, compiler optimizations
might actually make a noticeable difference. The environment variable
OPTIMIZE can be set to:

- OPTIMIZE="default" (or, unset) builds with -O2 -march=native.

- OPTIMIZE="slack" builds with standard Slackware flags. Use if you're
  going to e.g. build a package on a system with SSE2 that you're going
  to install on a system without SSE2.

- OPTIMIZE="upstream" builds with -O3 -march=native. This requires up
  to 6GB of memory (ram+swap) and takes up to 10 times as long to build.
