SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio 
synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It provides an interpreted object
oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the art, 
realtime sound synthesis server.

This requires libsndfile, scons, icu4c, and jack-audio-connection-kit.
