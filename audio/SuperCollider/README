SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio 
synthesis and algorithmic composition.  It provides an interpreted object
oriented language which functions as a network client to a state of the art, 
realtime sound synthesis server.

This buildscript also includes SwingOSC which is a GUI Framework for
Supercollider.

To use scvim editor copy the contents of /usr/share/scvim/vim to ~/.vim/

This will perform setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep to /usr/bin/sclang,
/usr/bin/scsynth and /usr/bin/scvim. If you don't want this behaviour pass
CAPS="no" to the script.

This requires scons and jack-audio-connection-kit.
