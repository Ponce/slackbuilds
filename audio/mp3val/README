mp3val (tool for checking and fixing mp3 file integrity)

MP3val is a small, high-speed, free software tool for checking MPEG 
audio files' integrity. It can be useful for finding corrupted files 
(e.g. incompletely downloaded, truncated,containing garbage).
MP3val is also able to fix most of the problems.

The most common MPEG audio file type is MPEG 1 Layer III (mp3), but 
MP3val supports also other MPEG versions and layers. The tool is also 
aware of the most common types of tags (ID3v1, ID3v2, APEv2).

This build includes mp3valgui, a graphical frontend for mp3val. If you
don't need the frontend, set GUI=no in the script's environment.
