Sam is a very small Text-To-Speech (TTS) program written in C, that
runs on most popular platforms.
It is an adaption to C of the speech software SAM (Software Automatic
Mouth) for the Commodore C64 published in the year 1982 by Don't Ask
Software (now SoftVoice, Inc.).
It includes a Text-To-Phoneme converter called reciter and a
Phoneme-To-Speech routine for the final output.
It is so small that it will work also on embedded computers.
