decibel-audio-player (GTK+ audio player for GNU/Linux)

Decibel Audio Player is a GTK+ open-source (GPL) audio player for GNU/Linux.
It is very straightforward to use thanks to a clean and user-friendly interface.
It is especially targeted at Gnome and follows the Gnome HIG. 

Decibel Audio Player is built around a highly modular structure that lets the user
disable completely the features he does not need.
A disabled feature uses absolutely no memory and no processor time. 

Decibel Audio Player is a real audio player and does not include features that are
not meant to be part of an audio player.
These features, such as tagging files or burning CDs, generally have a better support
in dedicated software. If you are looking for an audio player than can make coffee,
then you should stay away from Decibel and give a try to other players (e.g., Amarok, Exaile).
