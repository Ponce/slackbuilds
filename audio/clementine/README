Clementine is a modern music player and library organiser. Clementine is a
port of Amarok 1.4, with some features rewritten to take advantage of Qt4.

Features:
* Search and play your local music library
* Listen to internet radio from Last.fm and SomaFM
* Edit tags on MP3 and OGG files, organise your music
* Cross-platform - works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux
* Native desktop notifications on Linux (libnotify) and Mac OS X (Growl)

libimobiledevice and usbmuxd are optional dependencies, as is libvlc,
but vlc is not available on SlackBuilds.org.
