MusE is a MIDI/Audio sequencer with recording and editing capabilities
written originally by Werner Schweer now developed and maintained by
the MusE development team. MusE aims to be a complete multitrack
virtual studio for Linux, it is published under the GNU General Public
License.

Optional dependencies are fluidsynth, lash and lilv.

To start MusE, the user has to be in the "audio" group.

NOTE: it seems like native vst support is broken on x86 so we
disable it on this platform: vst plugins on x86 can still be used
through the optional dependency dssi-vst.
