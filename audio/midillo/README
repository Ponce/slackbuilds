midillo (MIDI file tools)

midillo is a library and set of tools for MIDI files manipulation. At
this point it consists of simple diagnostic dump of MIDI file (mididump),
a filter that strips unwanted events (midifilter), and a converter to
SMF format 0 files (midi2f0), so that a keyboard which is not as capable
as a computer would understand it.
