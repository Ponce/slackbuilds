Mp3Splt-project is a utility to split mp3 and ogg files selecting a begin
and an end time position, without decoding. It's very useful to split
large mp3/ogg to make smaller files or to split entire albums to obtain
original tracks. If you want to split an album, you can select split
points and filenames manually or you can get them automatically from CDDB
(internet or a local file) or from .cue files. Supports also automatic
silence split, that can be used also to adjust cddb/cue splitpoints. You
can extract tracks from Mp3Wrap or AlbumWrap files in few seconds.

Mp3splt-project is divided in 3 parts (all available from SlackBuilds.org):
 - libmp3splt, a library (created from mp3splt version 2.1c)
 - mp3splt, a command line program
 - mp3splt-gtk, a GTK2 gui
