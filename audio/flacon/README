flacon (Audio File Encoder)

Flacon extracts individual tracks from one big audio file containing the entire album
of music and saves them as separate audio files.

To do this, it uses information from the appropriate CUE file.
Besides, Flacon makes it possible to conveniently revise or specify tags both for all
tracks at once or for each tag separately.

Features:

 * Supported input formats: WAV, FLAC, APE, WavPack, True Audio (TTA).
 * Supported out formats: FLAC, WAV, WavPack, AAC, OGG or MP3.
 * Replay Gain analysis (album-gain and track-gain modes).
 * Multi-threaded conversion process.
 * Automatic character set detection for CUE files.
 * Generation of the pertrack CUE file in the output dir.

Optional dependencie: qt5

 * For build this package with Qt5, please add " -DUSE_QT5=Yes " on cmake options in SlackBuild file.
