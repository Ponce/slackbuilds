Podget is a simple podcast aggregator optimized for running as
a scheduled background job (i.e. cron). It features support for
downloading podcasts from RSS & XML feeds, for sorting the files into
folders & categories, for importing URLs from iTunes PCAST files & OPML
lists automatic M3U & ASX playlist creation, and automatic cleanup of
old files.  It also features automatic UTF-16 conversion for podcasts
hosted on MS Windows servers.

Run podget once to install the configuration files to $HOME/.podget,
and then customize them there.
