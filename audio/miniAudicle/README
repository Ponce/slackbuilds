The miniAudicle is a light-weight integrated development environment
for the ChucK digital audio programming language.
It can be used as a standalone ChucK development + runtime + on-the-fly
programming environment, or in conjunction with traditional command-line
modes of 'chuck' operation and with other chuck tools.

Please e-mail me if it works for 64-bit.

SOUNDENGINE=jack or SOUNDENGINE=oss to enable jack or oss support:
in these cases you will need jack-audio-connection-kit or oss (and
the build script will produce a different binary).
SOUNDENGINE=alsa is the default.
