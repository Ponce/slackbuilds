Calf "legacy" audio plugin pack for LADSPA and JACK. Contains effects
(flanger, reverb, tape-like delay, phaser, rotary speaker, multi-mode
filter, multi-tap chorus and compressor) and instruments (organ simulator
and a monophonic synthesizer). This is the last release of Calf that
supports LADSPA.

This build only contains LADSPA plugins. It can be installed on the same
system as the main "calf" build without conflict. If you're looking for
LV2 plugins and/or the standalone calfjackhost, see the main "calf" build.
The main purpose for calf-ladspa is to allow old Ardour/etc sessions
to keep working after upgrading calf to the new non-LADSPA version. New
projects should use the LV2 plugins in the calf build, since that's what
upstream supports.

If you're looking for DSSI, please contact the script maintainer. Adding
DSSI to this build is possible, but more work than I want to do unless
someone actually *needs* it for opening old sessions.
