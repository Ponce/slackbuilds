If you want to easily tag multiple MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, FLAC, MPC, MP4/AAC,
MP2, Speex, TrueAudio and WavPack files (e.g. full albums) without
typing the same information again and again and have control over both
ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags, then Kid3 is the program you are looking for.

kid3-cli for command line execution.

libmp4v2 (for MP4 support), chromaprint (for fingerprinting detection)
and ffmpeg are optional dependencies.
