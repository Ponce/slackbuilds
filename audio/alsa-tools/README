alsa-tools includes card-specific tools for various soundcards,
including firmware loaders for pcmcia and USB devices.

This package includes the firmware as well as the loaders (so there's
no need for a separate alsa-firmware package like Debian has).

This build includes udev rules for the Tascam US-122, US-224,
and US-428 USB audio interfaces (which replace the old hotplug
scripts shipped with the alsa-tools source). Also included
is the SlackBuild author's "tascam-us122-HOWTO" document (see
/usr/doc/alsa-tools-$VERSION).

Included tools:

  as10k1 - assembler for emu10k1 DSP chip found in Creative soundcards
  cspctl - Sound Blaster 16 ASP/CSP control program
  dl10k1 - loads dumps previously created with lo10k1 & ld10k1
* echomixer - Linux equivalent of the Echoaudio console application
* envy24control - Control tool for Envy24 (ice1712) based soundcards
  hda-verb - send a HD-audio command to an intel-hda hwdep device
* hdajackretask - retask the hardware jacks on intel-hda devices
* hdspconf - GUI to control the Hammerfall HDSP Alsa Settings
  hdsploader - firmware loader for the RME Hammerfall DSP cards
* hdspmixer - Linux equivalent of the Totalmix application from RME
  hwmixvolume - hardware mixer control for cards using hardware mixing
  init_audigy, init_audigy_eq10, init_live - initialize Creative cards
  ld10k1 - dump patches stored in an EMU10K1/EMU10K2 card
  ld10k1d - daemon for lo10k1
  lo10k1 - EMU10K1 (EMU10K2) patch loader for ALSA
  mixartloader - Firmware loader for Digigram miXart soundcards
  pcxhrloader - Firmware loader for Digigram pcxhr compatible cards
* qlo10k1 - GUI for loading patches on EMU10K1/EMU10K2 cards
* rmedigicontrol - control tool for RME Digi32 and RME Digi96 cards
  sbiload - OPL2/3 FM instrument loader for ALSA hwdep
  sscape_ctl - ALSA SoundScape control utility
  us428control - Tascam US-428 control surface daemon
  usx2yloader - 2nd Phase Firmware loader for Tascam USX2Y USB cards
  vxloader - Firmware loader for Digigram VX soundcards

(Older versions included the tools "ac3dec" and "extract_ac3", which
were removed from 1.0.27, probably for legal reasons)

Tools marked with an * are GUI tools that require X. To build on an
X-less system, set GUI=no in the environment.

Optional dependencies:

qt3 - only used for qlo10k1 tool (used for loading patches into emu10k1
      cards with a hardware MIDI synth). This tool won't be built, if
      qt3 is not installed (or QT3=no or GUI=no is set in the
      environment).

fltk - only used for the hdspconf and hdspmixer tools (only useful for
       Hammerfall HDSP cards). This tool won't be built, if fltk is not
       installed (or FLTK=no or GUI=no is set in the environment).
