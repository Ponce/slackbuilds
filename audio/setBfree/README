MIDI-controlled, software synthesizer designed to imitate the sound
and properties of the electromechanical organs and sound modification
devices that brought world-wide fame to the names and products of
Laurens Hammond and Don Leslie. 

This requires one of the jack varieties.

Optional dependencies are lv2,liblo and ftgl to build the
standalone and lv2 OpenGL UI:
For the LV2 GUI you need a LV2 host with Gtk support, like jalv.
jalv.gtk -l ~/.config/setBfree http://gareus.org/oss/lv2/b_synth

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
