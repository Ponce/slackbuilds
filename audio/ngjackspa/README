ngjackspa (JACK host for LADSPA plugins)

ngjackspa is a set of simple user interfaces that host a LADSPA plugin,
providing JACK ports for its audio inputs and outputs, and dynamic
setting of its control inputs. Additionally, the plugin controls can
be exported to or controlled by control voltages on standard JACK audio
ports.

By default, the command-line (jackspa-cli), ncurses (njackspa), and
gtkmm (gjackspa) user interfaces are built, and the qt4 one (qjackspa)
is disabled. To build the qt4 UI, export QT=yes in the script's
environment. You can also disable gtkmm with GTKMM=no.

Note: gjackspa and qjackspa won't appear in your desktop startup menu.
This is because they require command-line arguments (the plugin
library and ID).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
