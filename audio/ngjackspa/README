ngjackspa (JACK host for LADSPA plugins)

ngjackspa is a set of simple user interfaces that host a LADSPA plugin,
providing JACK ports for its audio inputs and outputs, and dynamic setting
of its control inputs. Additionally, the plugin controls can be exported
to or controlled by control voltages on standard JACK audio ports.

By default, both the Qt and gtkmm user interfaces are built.  To disable 
one or both of them, set QT=no and/or GTKMM=no in the script's environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
