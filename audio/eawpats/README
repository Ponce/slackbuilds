eawpats is a sound patches library for TiMidity++.  This package
contains a patchset for the TiMidity++ MIDI player.  A patchset is
required for MIDI files to be audible through TiMidity++.  These
patches also work with applications that use SDL_mixer for MIDI audio.

Note that eawpats contains proprietary sound samples.  According to the
ALSA Wiki:

"Half of the patches in eawpats are derived from original Gravis
patches, and therefore may have some intellectual property issues."

If this is a concern to you, use freepats instead (however,
eawpats does sound nicer).  For more information, see
/usr/doc/eawpats-12/copyrigh.txt
