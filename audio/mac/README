mac (Monkey's Audio Linux port)

Monkey's Audio (aka APE) is a lossless audio compression format,
similar to FLAC. mac is a console frontend to Monkey's Audio, able to
encode and decode APE audio files.

Note: if you just want to listen to APE files, Slackware's mplayer
and audacious can already play them. If you just want to convert them
to some other format (wav, mp3, etc), Slackware's ffmpeg can already
decode them. The only real reason to install this package is for
converting files *to* APE format.

If you're building this for an old x86 CPU that doesn't support MMX,
set ASM=no in the script's environment.

The package is built using upstream's default optimization level,
which is -O3. If you suspect this is causing problems, rebuild with
FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the environment (this will force -O2). If this
actually fixes anything, please email the maintainer with the details.

Note: if you get "invalid input file" trying to encode a wav file, it
probably means the wav file uses floating point rather than 16-bit
integer samples. You can convert with sox:

  sox -G input.wav -b16 output.wav
