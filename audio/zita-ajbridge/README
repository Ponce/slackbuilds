zita-ajbridge (ALSA <=> JACK bridge)

zita-ajbridge provides two applications, zita-a2j and zita-j2a.  They
allow using an ALSA device as a Jack client, to provide additional
capture (a2j) or playback (j2a) channels. Functionally these are
equivalent to the alsa_in and alsa_out clients that come with JACK,
but they provide much better audio quality. The resampling ratio will
typically be stable within 1 PPM and change only very smoothly. Delay
will be stable as well even under worst case conditions, e.g. the JACK
client running near the end of the cycle.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
