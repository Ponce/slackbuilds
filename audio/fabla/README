Fabla is an open-source LV2 drum sampler plugin instrument. 

It is ideal for loading up your favorite sampled sounds and
bashing away on a MIDI controller, or beat programming.

It features an ADSR envelope which allows the shaping of
sounds in your bank independently of one another.

You can use jalv (available from SlackBuilds.org) to launch
this and other LV2 plugins as stand-alone applications. To
install a .desktop file for Fabla, use JALV=yes when you run
the SlackBuild, like this:


# JALV=yes ./fabla.SlackBuild
