ncspot (TUI Spotify client)

ncspot is a cross-platform ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using
librespot. It is heavily inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc.

A premium Spotify account is needed to use the application; users will
be prompted to log in to Spotify when running for the first time.

Spotify credentials are stored separately for each user at
~/.config/ncspot/credentials.toml. This file, as well as the
~/.config/ncspot directory, is created automatically after logging in to
Spotify through ncspot.

ncspot can be configured using ~/.config/ncspot/config.toml on a per-
user basis. See users.md in the doc directory for details.

A list of active keybindings can be accessed in-application with:

ueberzug is an optional dependency for displaying album covers; use

  COVERS=yes ./ncspot.SlackBuild

to compile the feature in. Please note that upstream does not consider
album cover display to be essential functionality, and it may not work
in some terminal emulators and/or window managers.
