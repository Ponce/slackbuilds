# Simple KDialog-based launcher for Bristol synth. Bristol is a
# GUI application once it's running, but it emulates 40+ different
# synths, and the only way to choose the synth is by passing an
# argument to startBristol (e.g. -mini or -prophet).

# We want to be able to launch it from a .desktop file, which means
# one of three things:

# 1. The .desktop file would have a synth type hardcoded, other emulations
#    would require CLI startup.
# 2. There would have to be 40+ .desktop files, one per synth type (ugh).
# 3. The .desktop file would launch some kind of selector to let the user
#    pick the synth type. That's what this script is for.

# This works, but doesn't offer a way to set any of the other CLI
# options. We have "-jack" hardcoded here, since I doubt many people
# ever use "-alsa" with bristol...

# If this file exists, it contains the last choice the user made,
# last time this script was run and its OK button pressed.
# Pressing Cancel doesn't create or alter this file.
file=~/.launch-bristol

# This is more complex than it should be, because kdialog's --default
# option requires the *text* of the selected item (e.g. 'moog mini'),
# but kdialog doesn't print this text (it prints the ID of the option,
# e.g. '-mini'). So this script greps itself to find the item text
# that goes with the saved item ID.

# Try to center the window. Unfortunately kdialog's not smart enough
# to auto-size, I have to hardcode a width and height to avoid having
# a tiny window that requires a ton of scrolling. Also I have no idea
# how (or if) the font and font-size are chosen...
