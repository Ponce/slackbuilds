Probably the simplest and fastest audio player for Linux.

Pogo plays your music. Nothing else. It is both fast and easy-to-use.
The clear interface uses the screen real-estate very efficiently.
Other features include: 
Fast search on the harddrive and in the playlist, smart album grouping,
cover display, desktop notifications and no music library.

Pogo is a fork of Decibel Audio Player and supports most common audio formats.
It is written in Python and uses GTK+ and gstreamer.
