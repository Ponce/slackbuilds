lingot (musical instrument tuner)

Lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and
highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars,
its configurability gives it a more general character.

lingot can use JACK, PulseAudio, ALSA, or OSS for audio input.

By default, this script builds lingot with JACK support, meaning jack
is required. Most people who connect musical instruments to their
Slackware box will want JACK, since it's required by most serious
studio apps (e.g. ardour). You can disable JACK by setting JACK=no in
the environment.

PulseAudio is enabled by default. You can disable it with PULSE=no in
the environment.

OSS is disabled by default, since not many people still use it. You
can enable it with OSS=yes in the environment.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
