.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
stretchplayer [\fIfile\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBstretchplayer\fP is an audio file player that allows you to change
the speed of the song without changing the pitch. It will also allow
you to transpose the song to another key (while also changing the
speed independently). This is a very powerful tool for musicians who
are learning to play a pre\-recorded song. Its features include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Time Stretch (25% to 125% of song speed, without changing pitch)
.IP \(bu 2
Pitch shift (up or down 1 octave)
.IP \(bu 2
A/B repeat
.IP \(bu 2
Lots of keyboard accelerators
.UNINDENT
.sp
The player supports all the audio formats that libsndfile supports, which
currently includes OGG/Vorbis, WAV, W64, AIFF, SND, and FLAC. Note that
neither libsndfile nor StretchPlayer supports MP3 files for patent liability
reasons.
.sp
\fBstretchplayer\fP takes no arguments other than an optional \fIfile\fP to play.
