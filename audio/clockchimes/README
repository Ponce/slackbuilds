Clockchimes creates a cron job that runs a sox based bash script.
The script plays clock chime sound files based on the system time.
As of v0.3 the script plays multiple chime types:
  * Ave Maria
  * Voice sample
  * Westminster (default)
  * Whittington

The package installs a config file: /etc/clockchimes.conf.
The config file enables the selection of:
  * chime type
  * play either, or both, chimes and strikes
  * increase or decrease volume

The package has sample KDE desktop files that enable single-click
changing of the chime type played. The files can be found at
/usr/doc/clockchimes-x.x/ and copied to the KDE desktop:
  * Ave Maria Chimes.desktop
  * Westminster Chimes.desktop
  * Whittington Chimes.desktop
  * Voice Sample.desktop

The package installs a crontab file: /etc/cron.d/clockchimes
The crontab runs the script on:
  * 00, 15, 30 & 45 minute

The package no longer modifies /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root file. Instead
the package installs /etc/cron.d/clockchimes as the controlling crontab.
The user no longer has to manually remove crontab entries after an uninstall
of clockchimes-03 or greater.
