# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

shell-fm:
shell-fm: shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio
shell-fm: streams. It's pretty small (the binary is currently a little smaller
shell-fm: than 60K, or 50K when stripped) and it has most features the
shell-fm: "official" player has, if not even a few more.
