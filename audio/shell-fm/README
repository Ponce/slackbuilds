shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio
streams.  It's pretty small (the binary is currently a little
smaller than 60K, or 50K when stripped) and it has most features the
"official" player has, if not even a few more. Additional features
are, for example:

- network interface (control shell-fm remotely)
- autoban (automatically ban all tracks of an artist you don't like)
- bookmark stations (quickly jump to bookmarked stations with a single
  key)
- ... probably more

*NOTE: Last-FM have changed their API so that only PAID subscribers
can listen to streams in shell-fm.
