fmit (Free Music Instrument Tuner)

fmit (Free Music Instrument Tuner) is a piece of software for tuning
musical instruments, using Qt as a GUI library, supporting ALSA,
PulseAudio, JACK, OSS, or PortAudio for audio input. Features error
and volume history, tuning scales using Scala (.scl) files, microtonal
tuning, harmonic ratios, wave shapes, and more.

fmit will always be built with support for ALSA and PulseAudio. If
jack and/or portaudio are installed, they will be autodetected
(but may be disabled via JACK=no and/or PORTAUDIO=no in the
environment).

If OSS support is desired, export OSS=yes in the environment.

When built with jack support, this package uses POSIX
filesystem capabilities to execute with elevated privileges
(required for realtime audio processing). This may be considered a
security/stability risk. Please read http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/
for more information. To disable capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the
script (or JACK=no if you don't need jack).
