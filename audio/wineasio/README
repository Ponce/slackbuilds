wineasio (an ASIO to JACK driver for WINE)

WineASIO provides an ASIO to JACK driver for WINE. ASIO is the most
common Windows low-latency driver, so is commonly used in audio
workstation programs.

After installing the package, each user who will use wineasio must
run the command "regsvr32 wineasio.dll". This must be done as the
user(s), not as root. This only needs to be done once per user. See
the wineasio README.md for more information.

Note: If multilib is installed, this *should* build a package with
support for both 32-bit and 64-bit wine, but it hasn't been tested by
the SlackBuild maintainer.
