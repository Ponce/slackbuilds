DarkIce is a live audio streamer. It records audio from an audio
interface (e.g. sound card), encodes it and sends it to a streaming
server.

DarkIce can record from:

 - OSS audio devices
 - ALSA audio devices
 - Solaris audio interface
 - Jack sources
 - uLaw audio input through a serial interface
 - CoreAudio (branch darkice-macosx)

DarkIce can encode in the following formats:

 - MP3 - using the lame library
 - MP2 - using the twolame library
 - Ogg Vorbis
 - Opus
 - AAC - using the faac library
 - AAC HEv2 - using libaacplus library

DarkIce can send the encoded stream to the following streaming servers:

 - ShoutCast
 - IceCast 1.3.x and 2.x
 - Darwin Streaming Server
 - archive the encoded audio in files

Note:
This package optionally uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To enable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=yes to the script.

Optional dependencies: lame, opus, faac, twolame, jack-audio-connection-kit
