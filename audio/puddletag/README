Puddletag is a audio tag editor for GNU/Linux similar to the Windows
program Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux, it uses a
spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand
are visible and easily editable.

Optional dependencies:
pyacoustid - enables AcoustID support for music tagging
quodlibet - supports importing Quod Libet music libraries
