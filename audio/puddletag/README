Puddletag is a audio tag editor for GNU/Linux similar to the
Windows program Mp3tag. Unlike most taggers for GNU/Linux, it uses a
spreadsheet- like layout so that all the tags you want to edit by hand
are visible and easily editable.

Optional / Recommended packages are: gst0-ffmpeg, gst0-plugins-bad,
gst0-plugins-ugly, gst0-python, quodlibet, and chromaprint.
