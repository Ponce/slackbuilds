invada_studio_plugins_lv2 (Audio plugins for LV2)

Plugins include delay, tube warmth/distortion simulation, compression,
low and high pass filters, stereo phaser, reverb, an input module,
peak/VU/spectrograph meters, and a test tone generator.

This package requires lv2core, available at SlackBuilds.org.

As shipped, the package is built with -O3. If you for some reason want
to use Slackware standard CFLAGS, set FORCE_SLACK_CFLAGS=yes in the
build environment.
