crip (terminal-based ripper/encoder/tagger tool).

Crip is a terminal-based ripper/encoder/tagger tool for creating Ogg 
Vorbis/FLAC/MP3 files under UNIX/Linux. It is well-suited for anyone 
(especially the perfectionist) who seeks to make a lot of files from 
CDs and have them all properly labeled and professional-quality with 
a minimum of hassle and yet still have flexibility and full control. 

Current versions of Crip only support Ogg Vorbis and FLAC. If you  
still want to make MP3 files go back to the past and use crip-1.0.

This script is special because it is capable of doing group
vorbisgain/replaygain and/or normalization (adjust the volume to be
as loud as possible without clipping/distortion) and group
labelling/tagging, which makes it easy to allow a group of tracks to
be treated as one piece. It can also trim off the silence at the
beginning and end of these tracks/groups.

Copy /usr/doc/crip-3.9/criprc_example to your $HOME/.criprc.
