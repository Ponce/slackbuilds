mpd (Music Player Daemon)

Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, MIDI, and wave files) and managing playlists.
MPD is designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network. It also makes
a great desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie,
like frontend options, or restart X often.
