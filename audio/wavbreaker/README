wavbreaker is an open source WAV and MP3 file splitter.

wavbreaker is a GTK gui application which takes WAV or MP3 files and
breaks them up into multiple sections. For MP3 manipulation wavbreaker
uses libmpg123. It also has command line tools which will merge WAV
files (wavmerge) and display format information for WAV files (wavinfo).
