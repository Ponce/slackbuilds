azr3 (tonewheel organ simulator for jack-audio-connection-kit)

azr3 is a JACK port of the free VST plugin AZR-3. It is a tonewheel
organ with drawbars, distortion and rotating speakers.
The original was written by Rumpelrausch Täips

The organ has three sections, two polyphonic with 9 drawbars each and
one monophonic bass section with 5 drawbars. The two polyphonic
sections respond to events on MIDI channel 1 and 2, and an optional
keyboard split function makes the bass section listen to the lower
keys on channel 1.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing).
This may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
