Jack Meter is a basic console based DPM (Digital Peak Meter) for
JACK. The author wrote it for quickly checking remote signal levels,
without having to run X11 to use a pretty graphical meter such as
meterbridge.

Note: the package is called jackmeter, but the actual binary is called
jack_meter (with underscore).

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
