Upgrade notes:

It's a terrible idea to upgrade plugins while running programs are
still using them. Make sure you exit any application(s) that use the
caps plugins before upgrading.

Plugin names and parameters can and do change, between caps releases. If
you're upgrading from an older version, be aware that any of your scripts
or projects that use caps (e.g. Ardour sessions, or jack-rack presets)
might need updating, especially if you're upgrading from a really old
version.

For Ardour, if the changes prevent your session from loading, try:

- Make a backup of your session directory (done with cp or tar, whatever).
- Start ardour3 with the -d (or --disable-plugins) option.
- Load the session.
- Remove the offending plugins from their tracks or busses.
- Save the session.
- Exit Ardour.
- Start ardour3 normally.
- Load the session again.
- Add the plugins back. Manually.

If all else fails and you want to downgrade back to an older version,
you can still build many of them with this SlackBuild. Upstream removes
the old sources from their site, but there are several versions archived
here:

http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps_0.9.7.tar.bz2
[no documentation available for 0.9.7; package won't contain docs]

http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps_0.9.20.tar.bz2
http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps-doc-unofficial_0.9.20.tar.bz2

http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps_0.9.24.tar.bz2
http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps-doc-unofficial_0.9.24.tar.bz2

Build with a command like:

  root@box:caps# VERSION=0.9.7 ./caps.SlackBuild

md5sums of the above files:

7eea7c1f30363cca78f600544de271f4  caps-doc-unofficial_0.9.20.tar.bz2

Other old versions not listed here may work, but haven't been tested.

At some point, I may be forced to change the SlackBuild in a way that
will break compatibility with old versions. If that happens, and you
still need an old version, please let me know (at the email address in
the .info file).
