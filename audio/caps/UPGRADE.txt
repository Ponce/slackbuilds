0.9.24 upgrade notes:

Some of the plugin names and/or their parameters have changed since the
old (0.9.7 or 0.9.20) SlackBuild.

If you're upgrading from 0.9.7, be aware that any of your scripts
or projects that use caps (e.g. Ardour sessions, or jack-rack presets)
will need updating. For Ardour 2.x, if the changes prevent your session
from loading, try:

- Make a backup of your session directory (done with cp or tar, whatever).
- Start ardour2 with the -d (or --disable-plugins) option, load the session.
- Remove the offending plugins from their tracks or busses.
- Save and exit
- Start ardour2 normally, load the session.
- Add the plugins back.

If all else fails and you want to downgrade back to 0.9.7, you can
still build it with this SlackBuild. Upstream removed the 0.9.7
source from their site, but there's a copy here:

http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps_0.9.7.tar.bz2

Build with: VERSION=0.9.7 DOCS=no ./caps.SlackBuild

You can still build 0.9.20 as well:

http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps_0.9.20.tar.bz2
http://urchlay.naptime.net/~urchlay/src/caps-doc-unofficial_0.9.20.tar.bz2

Build with: VERSION=0.9.20 ./caps.SlackBuild
