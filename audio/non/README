Non is a modular (in the Unix sense) DAW, and is designed
to be fast enough to run on low-end processors.

MODULES:

The components of Non work together and separately, allowing you
create a studio tailored to your own needs.

If you want to build only one component of Non, you may pass the name
of that component to the SlackBuild script as the variable PROJECT.
For instance:

PROJECT=mixer ./non.SlackBuild

The component names are:
mixer|sequencer|timeline|session-manager

By default, this SlackBuild builds everything, so the result is a
complete, traditional DAW-like suite.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY:

The `import-ardour-session` script requires Python2.
This script hasn't been updated in years, and may not successfully
import a modern Ardour project file, so this is an optional
dependency and subject to your own experimentation.
