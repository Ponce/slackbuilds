# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

twolame: twolame (an MP2 Encoder)
twolame:
twolame: TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder.
twolame: TwoLAME should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for
twolame: LAME (a MPEG Layer 3 encoder). The frontend takes very similar
twolame: command line options to LAME, and the backend library has a very
twolame: similar API to LAME.
