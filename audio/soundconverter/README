SoundConverter is the leading audio file converter for the GNOME Desktop.
It reads anything GStreamer can read (Ogg Vorbis, AAC, MP3, FLAC, WAV,
AVI, MPEG, MOV, M4A, AC3, DTS, ALAC, MPC, Shorten, APE, SID, MOD, XM,
S3M, etc...), and writes to Opus, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, WAV, AAC, and MP3
files, or use any GNOME Audio Profile. SoundConverter aims to be simple
to use and very fast. Thanks to its multithreaded design, it will use
as many cores as possible to speed up the conversion. It can also
extract the audio from videos.

Optional dependencies for more audio support are gst0-plugins-bad,
gst0-plugins-ugly, and gst0-ffmpeg.
