jalv (host for LV2 plugins)

Jalv is a simple but fully featured LV2 host for Jack. It runs LV2
plugins and exposes their ports as Jack ports, essentially making any
LV2 plugin function as a Jack application.

Jalv is a small program which is useful, but also intended to be an
appropriate test host for plugin development. It runs plugins from
the command line with no user interaction, is light enough to run in
valgrind, and is capable of dumping all plugin to/from UI communication
in a human readable format.

For testing with various host toolkits, there are several Jalv
executables:

jalv        - textmode shell-like UI
jalv.gtk    - GTK+2
jalv.gtk3   - GTK+3
jalv.gtkmm  - GTKMM with GTK+2
jalv.qt     - Qt4 (optional; only built if qt4 is installed)
jalv.qt5    - Qt5

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
