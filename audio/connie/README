connie (organ synth for JACK)

connie is a simple simulation of an electronic organ like e.g. Vox
Continental, with JACK MIDI input and JACK audio output. Its design
is lightweight, allowing it to be used on lower-end machines that
might not be able to handle heavier synths (the author describes it as
"eeepc-friendly").

By default, connie is built with SSE math support. If installing on a
system without SSE ("grep sse /proc/cpuinfo" will tell you), set SSE=no
in the script's environment.

connie's standard user interface is console-based. If you want to
also build a simple Qt user interface, set QT=yes in the script's
environment.  The Qt version is called connie_qt4. It accepts the same
arguments as the terminal version, but doesn't support any keyboard
commands.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
