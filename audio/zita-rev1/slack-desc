# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

zita-rev1: zita-rev1 (reverb audio effect)
zita-rev1:
zita-rev1: zita-rev1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for
zita-rev1: Aeolus. Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used
zita-rev1: on a wide variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser -
zita-rev1: the early reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do
zita-rev1: not correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match left
zita-rev1: and right sources to some extent.
