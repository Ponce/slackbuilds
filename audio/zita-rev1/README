zita-rev1 (reverb audio effect)

zita-rev1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for
Aeolus. Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used
on a wide variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser -
the early reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not
correspond to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and
right sources to some extent.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for realtime audio processing). This
may be considered a security/stability risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script.
