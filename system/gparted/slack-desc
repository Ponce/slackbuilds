# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gparted: gparted (Gnome Partition Editor)
gparted:
gparted: GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and
gparted: partition tables.  Several (optional) "file system" tools provide
gparted: support for file systems not included in libparted.  These optional
gparted: packages will be detected at runtime and do not require a rebuild
gparted: of GParted.  GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm for its
gparted: Graphical User Interface (GUI).
