GParted uses GNU libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partition 
tables.  Several (optional) "file system" tools provide support for file 
systems not included in libparted.  These optional packages will be detected 
at runtime and do not require a rebuild of GParted.  GParted is written in 
C++ and uses gtkmm for it's Graphical User Interface (GUI).

gpart is an optional runtime dependency for using the 'Attempt Data Rescue'
function found in the 'Device' tab.
