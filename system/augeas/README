Augeas is a library and command line tool that focuses on the most basic
problem in handling Linux configurations programmatically: editing actual
configuration files in a controlled manner.

To that end, Augeas exposes a tree of all configuration settings (well,
all the ones it knows about) and a simple local API for manipulating the
tree. Augeas then modifies underlying configuration files according to
the changes that have been made to the tree; it does as little modeling
of configurations as possible, and focuses exclusivley on transforming
the tree-oriented syntax of its public API to the myriad syntaxes of
individual configuration files.
