cowsql is a C library that implements an embeddable and replicated
SQL database engine with high availability and automatic failover.

cowsql extends SQLite with a network protocol that can connect
together various instances of your application and have them act as
a highly-available cluster, with no dependency on external databases.

The name "cowsql" loosely refers to the "pets vs. cattle" concept,
since it's generaly fine to delete or rebuild a particular node of
an application that uses cowsql for data storage.

cowsql is a fork of Canonical's dqlite project, which was originally
written by cowsql's author himself while working at Canonical.
