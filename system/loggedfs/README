loggedfs (filesystem monitoring with FUSE)

LoggedFS is a fuse-based filesystem which can log every operation that
happens in it. LoggedFS only sends a message to syslog (or a file) when
called by fuse and then let the real filesystem do the rest of the job.

Note: loggedfs doesn't cross filesystem boundaries. If you e.g. have
/usr/local mounted as a separate partition, monitoring /usr won't also
monitor /usr/local (though you can always run another instance of loggedfs
in that case).

Slackware note: since Slackware's /etc/mtab is a regular file (not a
symlink to /proc/mounts), killing a loggedfs process causes its /etc/mtab
entry to stay. This makes it look like the filesystem is still mounted,
though it actually isn't. To avoid this, always use "fusermount -u"
to cleanly umount the fs, which will also make the loggedfs process exit.
