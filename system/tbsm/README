tbsm is a pure bash session or application launcher, inspired by cdm,
tdm and krunner.  It supports X and Wayland sessions.

Autostart tbsm upon login by adding the following to $HOME/.profile
(Reference: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Start_X_on_login):

# Autostart tbsm on tty1
if [[ -z $DISPLAY ]] && [[ $(tty) = /dev/tty1 ]]; then
    exec tbsm
fi
