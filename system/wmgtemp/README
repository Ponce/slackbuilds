wmgtemp is a dock app for WindowMaker that graphically displays the CPU and SYS temperatures 
using the lm_sensors package.

Note: This DockApp needs a lm_sensors config file (defaults to /etc/sensors.conf). I had
one called "sensors3.conf" in my etc folder. So I started wmgtemp like this:
"wmgtemp -S /etc/sensors3.conf" and it worked fine for me. If it doesn't for you, try
writing your own configuration file.
