VICE is the one and only Versatile Commodore Emulator. It provides emulation
of the Commodore C64, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II computers.

NOTE: To use the standard application menu instead of the in-emulator
PETSCII menu, GTK3 v3.22 is required.  Slackware 14.2 ships with 3.18 and
there is no upgrade package for this.  Slackware Current has 3.22.  So to
use the normal application menus, you either need to use Slackware Current
or find a way to upgrade your Slackware 14.2's GTK3 to v3.22.
