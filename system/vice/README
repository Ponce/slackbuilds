vice (Commodore 8-bit emulator)

VICE is the one and only Versatile Commodore Emulator. It provides
emulation of the Commodore C64, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4 and CBM-II
computers.

This build includes both the GTK+3 and SDL2[*] menu-based user
interfaces. The SDL2 binaries are installed with -sdl2 suffix,
e.g. x64-sdl2 and x128-sdl2.

[*] If you'd rather build with SDL 1.x for some reason, set SDL=1 in
the environment. The SDL1 binaries are installed with -sdl1 suffix.
It's also possible to omit the SDL binaries entirely with SDL=no.

To build without PulseAudio, set PULSE=no in the environment.
