# 20240213 bkw: update for v3.8.
# - had to add --disable-parsid to the configure command. it was breaking
#   the build. also, do you really have a SID chip connected to your
#   parallel port? (do you even *have* a parallel port?)... if so, either
#   send me a patch, or wait until upstream does another release.
# - LAME is no longer supported, remove --enable-lame.
# - add --enable-catweasel.

# 20230504 bkw: BUILD=2.
# - fix vice.texi so the GNU info file gets generated.
# - remove old ./configure arguments and fix a couple of wrong ones.
#   thanks to Franzen for sending a patch to fix this.
# - changed -Wl,--allow-multiple-definition to -fcommon, which does
#   basically the same thing but matches how other builds do it.
# - fix doinst.sh silliness.
# - add douninst.sh, to clean up /usr/info/dir after the package is removed.

# 20221228 bkw: update for v3.7.1.

# 20221129 bkw: update for v3.6.1.
# - can't build our own HTML or plaintext docs from vice.texi.
# - include upstream's HTML docs in package.

# 20210809 bkw: update for v3.5, many changes, can't build old versions.
# - Relicense as WTFPL, with permission from the original author.
# - Build & install the actual HTML docs (not the bundled copy of
#   the upstream website).
# - Don't install fonts. They were part of the above.
# - Use upstream's .desktop files instead of our own.
# - Upstream removed the man pages; restore them (for now).
# - Build the gtk+3 UI. Also build the SDL2 UI, unless the user's
#   requested the SDL1 one (or disabled SDL).
# - Really fix the paths in the documentation.
# - ffmpeg now included in Slackware (pre-15.0 -current). Still
#   autodetected, but the docs no longer mention it.
# - Get rid of README_SBo.txt as the build options are simpler
#   and "fit" in the regular README now.

# 20200801 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance
# - Autodetect ffmpeg
# - Allow building with SDL 1.x
# - Allow building without pulseaudio
# - Get rid of xa dep
# - Install TTF fonts in correct place, get rid of other formats
# - install-info in doinst.sh so vice.info shows up in the info dir
# - Have slack-desc show build options
# - Re-enable the old x64 emulator
# - BUILD=3
