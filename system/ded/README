ded (directory editor)

ded (pronounced "dee-eee-dee") allows you to navigate through multiple
file lists or a directory tree, viewing or changing file attributes
rapidly. In addition to conventional file information, it operates on
the file's RCS or SCCS archives (or CVS or SVN, etc), making it useful
for source-control as well as system administration. Curses-based, it
runs on UNIX systems.

For those unfamiliar with ded, it's vaguely similar to Midnight
Commander, or dired mode in Emacs, but with vi-like key
bindings. Press h while ded is running to see its help screen.
