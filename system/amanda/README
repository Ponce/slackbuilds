AMANDA, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver, is a
backup system that allows the administrator of a LAN to set up a single
master backup server to back up multiple hosts to a single large capacity
tape drive.  AMANDA uses native dump and/or GNU tar facilities and can
back up a large number of workstations running multiple versions of Unix.
Recent versions can also use SAMBA to back up Microsoft Windows hosts.

You will need to have a special user and group created for AMANDA to use;
this defaults to user and group of "amanda" but you can specify whatever
group you wish - see the build script for more information.

After installing, see the /usr/doc/amanda-3.3.0/README.Slackware for
more information on how to modify inetd.conf to start the the Amanda
daemons automatically at boot.
