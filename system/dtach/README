dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen,
allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from
the controlling terminal and attach to it later. dtach does not keep
track of the contents of the screen, and thus works best with programs
that know how to redraw themselves. It is designed to be transparent and
un-intrusive; it avoids interpreting the input and output between
attached terminals and the program under its control.

dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its
support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. This
makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily
audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in
environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.
