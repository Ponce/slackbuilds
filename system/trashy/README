Usage
-------

Trashy is a simple shell script that introduces the idea of a trash
can for the command line.  Meaning that you can issue this command:

   $ trash foo bar

and the files 'foo' and 'bar' will be moved to your system trash.

or...

   $ trash baz\ quux

and the file 'baz quux' will be moved to your system trash.

Simple as that.  When you're really really sure that everything in
your Trash wants to be nuked out of existence, then you can
issue the command:

   $ trash --empty

and your system trash will be emptied.


System Trash
---------------

Trashy defines a "system trash" on Linux, BSD, and Solaris-based
operating systems in accordance to the Open Desktop standard:
~/.local/share/Trash

On systems that do not use a desktop, trashy simply creates a ~/.trash
folder (unless you sometimes use a desktop, in which case your
desktop's tash will be continued to be used).

On systems that do have a desktop but do not follow the Open Desktop
standard, trashy tries to conform with what they do use. If all else
fails, ~/.trash is used.
