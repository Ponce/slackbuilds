uptimed (An uptime deamon to log your best uptimes)

Stores your best uptime statistics in "/var/spool/uptimed/records"

The 'uprecords' command will display your best uptime results.

Note: See below on how to launch uptimed automatically.
Additional configuration via "/etc/uptimed.conf"
  (See "/etc/uptimed.conf-dist")

The uptimed daemon runs in the background and regularly stores the following 
data to "/var/spool/uptimed/records";
"<Uptime in seconds>:<Boot up in unixtime>:<System kernel name and release>"
The boot up value is used as a unique identifier.

See "uprecords -?" for additional record display options.

The "uprecords" file can be copied as "uprecords.cgi" to your CGI directory,
and will render Content-type head information and HTML tabs as necessary.
(See "INSTALL.cgi" in the extracted source for more information.)

To have the daemon launch automatically at boot time,
  1) Set the rc.uptimed file as executable;
	chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.uptimed
  2) Add an entry in rc.local with;
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.uptimed ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.uptimed start &
	fi

Q: Why are my records not saved between reboots? I can see the current uptime
  info with the 'uprecords' command.
A: The uptimed daemon was possibly not running to regularly save the data to the
  "/var/spool/uptimed/records" file. See above on how to automatically start
  the daemon, and confirm that the "/var/spool/uptimed" directory exists
  and is writable.

If performing an upgrade, you may need to chmod 755 rc.uptimed and restart the
daemon with "/etc/rc.d/rc.uptimed restart".
