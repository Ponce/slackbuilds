Zramen is a simple bash script that makes managing zram much easier.
This SlackBuild provides the zramen script but also a service script
compatible with sysvinit.

To enable zramen on startup, add the following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.zramen ]; then
  # Start Zramen
  /etc/rc.d/rc.zramen start
fi
