Mgen + is a composite font that uses a variety of kanji
and symbols based on the free font "M + OUTLINE FONTS",
and by supplementing the glyphs of the kanji and symbols
that are not included in it with "Noto Sans CJK /
Source Sans Japanese part",  This enhancement enables the
use of a wider variety of kanji and symbols.

This is a repackage for Slackware Linux.
