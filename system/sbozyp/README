Sbozyp is a package manager for SlackBuilds.org (SBo).

Sbozyp aims to strike a balance between being automatic like a
"normal" package manager such as apt, while still allowing for
manual use in a transparent and traditional Slackware-like way.

Sbozyp comes with a manual that fully details how to use it.
