kapacitor (An Open-Source Real-Time Streaming Data Processing Engine)

Kapacitor is a native data processing engine in the TICK Stack. It
can process both stream and batch data from InfluxDB. It lets you
plug in your own custom logic or user-defined functions to process
alerts with dynamic thresholds, match metrics for patterns, compute
statistical anomalies, and perform specific actions based on these
alerts like dynamic load rebalancing. It also integrates with HipChat,
OpsGenie, Alerta, Sensu, PagerDuty, Slack, and more.
