afdko (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType)

The goal of the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType package is to
share the tools used by Adobe font developers for wrapping up
PostScript (i.e. Type1) fonts as OpenType/CFF font files, and adding
OpenType layout features. These tools are used for in-house
development of new Adobe OpenType fonts.

Now that Libreoffice has dropped support for Type1 fonts, one can use
afdko to convert the system Type1 fonts to OTF, which
Libreoffice supports. The package Type1_to_OTF does this.

Warning: This SlackBuild requires network access when it runs, meaning
it downloads files from the Internet with root access. You should
decide for yourself whether or not you think this is a good idea.
