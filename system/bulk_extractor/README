bulk_extractor is a C++ program that scans a disk image, a file, or a directory
of files and extracts useful information without parsing the file system or
file system structures. The results are stored in feature files that can be
easily inspected, parsed, or processed with automated tools. bulk_extractor
also creates histograms of features that it finds, as features that are more
common tend to be more important.

bulk_extractor is distinguished from other forensic tools by its speed and
thoroughness.

Optional dependencies include libewf (recognized if installed) and afflib
(recognized if installed).

If you want to use the java based GUI (BEViewer), you will also need to have
java installed. This has been tested with JDK.
