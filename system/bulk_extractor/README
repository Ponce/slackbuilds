bulk_extractor is a C++ program that scans a disk image, a file, or
a directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing
the file system or file system structures. The results are stored in
feature files that can be easily inspected, parsed, or processed with
automated tools. bulk_extractor also creates histograms of features
that it finds, as features that are more common tend to be more
important.

bulk_extractor is distinguished from other forensic tools by its speed
and thoroughness.

Optional dependencies include libewf (recognized if installed) and
afflib (recognized if installed).

If you want to use the java based GUI (BEViewer), you will also need
to have java installed. This has been tested with JDK.
