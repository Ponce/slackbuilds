# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

rtirq: rtirq (set priorities on kernel IRQ threads)
rtirq:
rtirq: The rtirq script is a bash script written by Rui Nuno Capela which
rtirq: works in conjunction with the IRQ threading facility of the Linux
rtirq: kernel. The script takes advantage of the fact that the kernel can
rtirq: use threads for IRQ management, and as such these threads (like any
rtirq: other thread running on your system) can be given maximum priority
rtirq: in an effort to minimize the latency of audio peripherals.
