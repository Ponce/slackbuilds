Ansible (a ssh based config management framework)

A radically simple, model-driven orchestration solution that automates
configuration, software deployment, and other IT needs.

It comes as an easy-to-use and powerful alternative to infrastructure
management tools such as CFEngine, Chef, Puppet, and SaltStack.

*Note* that as the source tarball is hosted by github (nodeload), its filename
will vary depending on the download method. The filename may be "release1.2"
when downloaded via wget/curl or it may be "ansible-ansible-v1.2-*.tar.gz"
when downloaded via a browser. Any other form will not be accounted for, as
the SlackBuild script is set to handle only those two filename patterns.
