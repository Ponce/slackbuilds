QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.

When used as a machine emulator, QEMU can run OSes and programs made for 
one machine (e.g. an ARM board) on a different machine (e.g. your own PC). 
By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performances.

qemu (with kvm enabled) achieves near native performances by leveraging 
the kvm-kmod modules and executing the guest code directly on the host 
CPU.  Slackware provides pre-built 32/64 bit x86 kvm-kmod modules or you 
can build different versions with the kvm-kmod package.

By default, this script builds only the x86 and arm emulation targets
for qemu; if you prefer to build all supported targets, do this:

  TARGETS=all ./qemu.SlackBuild

Disable vnc support via:

  VNC_ENABLE=no ./qemu.SlackBuild

Audio drivers support defaults to "alsa,oss,sdl,esd" and can be adusted via

AUDIODRIVERS="alsa,oss" ./qemu.SlackBuild

We patch the installed udev rules to require membership in "users" 
group instead of a custom "kvm" group to use /dev/kvm.  If you prefer
something different, then run the build script like this:
  
  KVMGROUP=group ./qemu.SlackBuild

Don't forget to load the 'kvm-intel' or 'kvm-amd' module (depending on 
your processor) prior to launching qemu-system-ARCH with kvm enabled.
For older/unmaintained qemu frontends, this build also creates a symlink
to qemu-system-ARCH at /usr/bin/qemu-kvm.

spice, usbredir, and device-tree-compiler are optional dependencies.
If you wish to emulate ARM, you will want device-tree-compiler.

NOTES:
  This version breaks some backward compatibility with earlier versions.
  Consult the official changelogs for details.

  Slackware's libusb is too old. Thus, to enable usb redirection, install
  usbredir and build with LIBUSB=yes ./qemu.SlackBuild
