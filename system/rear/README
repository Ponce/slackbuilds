rear (bare metal disaster recovery and system migration tool)

Relax-and-Recover is the leading Open Source bare metal disaster recovery
and system migration solution. It is a modular framework with many
ready-to-go workflows for common situations.

Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can repartition the
system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup. Restores to
different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can therefore be used as a
migration tool as well.
