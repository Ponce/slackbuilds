z (jump around in bash/zsh)

z is a bash/zsh extension that tracks your most used directories,
based on 'frecency'. After a short learning phase, z will take you to
the most 'frecent' directory that matches ALL of the regexes given
on the command line, in order. For example, z foo bar would match
/foo/bar but not /bar/foo. Frecency is a portmanteau of 'recent' and
'frequency'.
