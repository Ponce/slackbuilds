SQLCipher is an SQLite extension that provides transparent 256-bit AES
encryption of database files. Pages are encrypted before being written to
disk and are decrypted when read back. Due to the small footprint and great
performance it's ideal for protecting embedded application databases and is
well suited for mobile development.

SQLCipher was initially developed by Stephen Lombardo at Zetetic LLC
(sjlombardo@zetetic.net) as the encrypted database layer for Strip, an iPhone
data vault and password manager (http://getstrip.com).
