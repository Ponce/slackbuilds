# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

virt-viewer: virt-viewer (lightweight graphical display for libvirt VMs)
virt-viewer:
virt-viewer: The "Virtual Machine Viewer" application (virt-viewer for short)
virt-viewer: is a lightweight interface for interacting with the graphical
virt-viewer: display of a libvirt guest OS.  It is intended as a replacement for
virt-viewer: the traditional vncviewer client, since the latter does not support
virt-viewer: SSL/TLS encryption of x509 certificate authentication.
virt-viewer:
virt-viewer: This software requires gtk-vnc, and optionally, spice.  If built
virt-viewer: without libvirt (>= 0.9.7), this package will only contain the
virt-viewer: remote-viewer client, a simple VNC/SPICE viewer.
