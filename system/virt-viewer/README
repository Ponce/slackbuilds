virt-viewer (lightweight graphical display for libvirt VMs)

The "Virtual Machine Viewer" application (virt-viewer for short)
is a lightweight interface for interacting with the graphical
display of a libvirt guest OS.  It is intended as a replacement for
the traditional vncviewer client, since the latter does not support
SSL/TLS encryption of x509 certificate authentication.

This software requires gtk-vnc and optionally, spice.  If built
without libvirt, this package will only contain the remote-viewer
client, a simple VNC/SPICE viewer.
