vcp (copy files via a curses interface)

vcp copies files and directories in a curses interface, with text only
output available. Its options and output are similar to BSD's cp while
adding some new features. It provides information on:

- files copied and left to copy

- data written and total data size

- data being written every second

- two status bars, one showing current file status, the other total
  status (except with 1 file, both show current), and percentage
