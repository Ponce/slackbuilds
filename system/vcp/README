vcp copies files and directories in a curses interface, with text only
output available. its options and output are similar to BSD's cp while
adding some new features.  It provides information on:

- files copied and left to copy

- data written and total data size

- data being written every second

- two status bars, one showing current file status, the other total status
(except with 1 file, both show current), and percentage
