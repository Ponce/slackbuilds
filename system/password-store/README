password-store is a simple password manager which uses GnuPG to 
securely encrypt and retrieve passwords.

By default, bash completion is installed as 
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/pass. Add 'source
/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/pass' to your .bashrc to enable it.

zsh and fish completion is also optionally included.
uncomment the lines in the SlackBuild to include it in the package.
