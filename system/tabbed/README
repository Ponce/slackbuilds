tabbed (framework for embeddable apps)

Simple generic tabbed frontend to xembed aware applications,
originally designed for surf but also usable with many other
applications, e.g. st, uzbl, urxvt, and xterm.

Recommended dependency: dmenu. tabbed is still useful without it, but
the control-` function won't work without it.

The default width and height for the tabbed window are hard-coded in
the application, and can be set by setting WIDTH and HEIGHT environment
variables. Default size is 800x600. Example:

  WIDTH=1024 HEIGHT=768 ./tabbed.SlackBuild

Note that the above only sets the default; you can use the -g option
to set the geometry, no matter what the default is.

For other customizations, you can create a diff and place it in
patches/.  See README.SBo for details.
