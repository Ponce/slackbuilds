The Xen hypervisor, a powerful open source industry standard for
virtualization, offers a powerful, efficient, and secure feature set for
virtualization of x86, x86_64, IA64, ARM, and other CPU architectures. It
supports a wide range of guest operating systems including Windows, Linux,
Solaris, and various versions of the BSD operating systems.

In order to run Xen, you will need to install and boot from a Xen dom0
kernel. Check README.dom0 (in docs/dom0) for more information on how to do
that.

This requires acpica. mbootpack is optional (see below).

Since booting Xen kernel with LILO is not supported by default we have to
use GRUB; alternatively, use mbootpack to create a LILO compatible kernel.

GRUB may be installed from Slackware's extra repository. The GRUB package
is not available from the Slackware x86_64 distribution, but the source and
a SlackBuild may be found in its extra/source repository.

See README.SLACKWARE (which is also installed with the package docs) for
setup, configuration, and usage hints.
