The Xen hypervisor, a powerful open source industry standard for
virtualization, offers a powerful, efficient, and secure feature set for
virtualization of x86, x86_64, IA64, ARM, and other CPU architectures. It
supports a wide range of guest operating systems including Windows, Linux,
Solaris, and various versions of the BSD operating systems.
