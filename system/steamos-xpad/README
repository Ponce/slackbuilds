This provides the SteamOS patched version of the kernel xpad driver. It
includes support for newer controllers and fixes a number of issues such
as incorrect button mapping. This driver works for some games where the
stock xpad driver will not.

This package includes a blacklist for the stock xpad module.
Either reboot or 'rmmod xpad' before using this module.
