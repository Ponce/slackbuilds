binfmt-support

The binfmt_misc kernel module, contained in versions 2.1.43 and later of the
Linux kernel, allows system administrators to register interpreters for
various binary formats based on a magic number or their file extension, and
cause the appropriate interpreter to be invoked whenever a matching file is
executed. Think of it as a more flexible version of the #! executable
interpreter mechanism.

binfmt-support provides an update-binfmts script with which package
maintainers can register interpreters to be used with this module without
having to worry about writing their own init.d scripts, and which sysadmins
can use for a slightly higher-level interface to this module.

To have binfmt-support start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support start
  fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.binfmt-support stop
  fi
