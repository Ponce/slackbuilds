DASH is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as 
small as possible.  It does this without sacrificing speed where possible. 
In fact, it is significantly faster than bash (the GNU Bourne-Again SHell) 
for most tasks.

To patch in fixes from current git, add 'USE_GIT_PATCH=yes' to the command
line when building, like this:

# USE_GIT_PATCH=yes sh dash.Slackbuild

or, if you use fakeroot to build:

$ fakeroot env USE_GIT_PATCH=yes sh dash.SlackBuild
