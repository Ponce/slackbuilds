Android File Transfer for Linux - reliable MTP client with
minimalistic UI similar to Android File Transfer for Mac.

Android File Transfer by default builds a Qt5 UI. This version of
Android File Transfer does not support Qt4.

To build only the command-line client (this does not require qt5), run
the script with the following command:

QT_GUI=no ./android-file-transfer.SlackBuild
