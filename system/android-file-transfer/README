Android File Transfer for Linux - reliable MTP client with
minimalistic UI similar to Android File Transfer for Mac.

Android File Transfer by default builds qt5 ui. This version
of Android File Transfer does not support qt4 ui.

In building only the command-line client (this does not require
qt5), run the script with the following command:

QT_GUI=no ./android-file-transfer.SlackBuild
