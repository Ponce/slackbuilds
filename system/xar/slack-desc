# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xar:
xar: The XAR project aims to provide an easily extensible archive
xar: format. Important design decisions include an easily extensible XML
xar: table of contents (TOC) for random access to archived files, storing
xar: the TOC at the beginning of the archive to allow for efficient
xar: handling of streamed archives, the ability to handle files of
xar: arbitrarily large sizes, the ability to choose independent encodings
xar: for individual files in the archive, the ability to store checksums
xar: for individual files in both compressed and uncompressed form, and the
xar: ability to query the table of content's rich meta-data.
