# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xar:
xar: XAR provides an easily extensible archive format. An XML table of
xar: contents, stored at the beginning of the archive, allows for random
xar: access to the archived files. XAR can handle files of arbitrarily
xar: large sizes, is able to encode individual files in the archive
xar: independently, can store checksums for individual files in both
xar: compressed and uncompressed form, can query the rich metadata of
xar: the table of contents.
