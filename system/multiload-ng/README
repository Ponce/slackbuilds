Multiload-ng is a near-complete rewrite of the old GNOME multiload
applet that aims to support *every* existing panel.

Note: upstream defaults are
 - build against GTK+3
 - build the standalone application
 - do not build the lxpanel plugin
 - do not build the mate panel plugin
 - build the generic system tray plugin
 - build the xfce4 panel plugin

The xfce4 panel plugin is disabled in this SlackBuid, because it won't
build with Slackware's version of XFCE4.

any of these may be overridden by passing its corresponding parameter to
the script, i. e.
 - GTK=2
 - STANDALONE=no
 - LXPANEL=yes
 - MATE=yes
 - SYSTRAY=no
 - XFCE4=yes (currently this causes the build to fail, patches welcome)

for example
   GTK=2 LXPANEL=yes ./multiload-ng.SlackBuild
