fsviewer (NextStep-like file browser)

FSViewer is a file system viewer for Window Maker, developed by George
Clernon visually and functionally in analogy to the Workspace Manager
of NeXTStep(TM).

Although fsviewer uses windowmaker's libraries, it will run under any
X window manager or desktop environment.

This build includes an optional patch that makes a minor change to
the UI (adds a titlebar). See README.patch.txt for details. To add
a titlebar to the initial viewer window, set TITLEBAR=yes in the
script's environment.
