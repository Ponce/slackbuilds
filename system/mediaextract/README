mediaextract (extract media files that are embedded in other files)

mediaextract extracts known media types such as RIFF, Ogg, etc,
from various 'resource' or 'archive' format files.  files. It works
by looking for 'magic' byte sequences (like the file(1) command
does). A typical use case would be extracting resources from a
game. mediaextract does not support compression (zip/rar/7z/etc), so
uncompress the file first, if necessary.
