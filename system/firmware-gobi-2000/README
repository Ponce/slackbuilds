Firmware and loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets. These
devices appear in an uninitialised state when power is applied and
require firmware to be loaded before they can be used as modems.
gobi_loader adds a udev rule that will trigger loading of the
firmware and make the modem usable.

Note:
No carrier specific card configuration may work with `CARRIER=UMTS' (default)
or `CARRIER=6' else pass `CARRIER=<sub-directory>' to the SlackBuild matching
your carrier or reseller/franchiser which is using the carrier.
It's strongly encouraged to explicit select a carrier.

After installation restart your system or use
`udevadm control --reload && udevadm trigger`.

For carrier information, see README.SBo
