The samhain open source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS)
provides file integrity checking and logfile monitoring/analysis, as
well as rootkit detection, port monitoring, detection of rogue SUID
executables, and hidden processes.

It has been designed to monitor multiple hosts with potentially different
operating systems, providing centralized logging and maintenance,
although it can also be used as standalone application on a single host.

See README.SLACKWARE for setup and configuration information.
