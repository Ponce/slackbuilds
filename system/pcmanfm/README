PCManFM is an extremely fast and lightweight GTK+ based file manager
which features tabbed browsing and a user-friendly interface.

By default the gtk+3 version is built: if you prefer to build the
gtk+2 one pass the script the parameter GTK3=no, like

  GTK3=no ./pcmanfm.SlackBuild

If you have problems viewing icons on pcmanfm and you're using the
gtk+2 version, include this line to your $HOME/.gtkrc-2.0:
gtk-icon-theme-name="Tango"
