Patool is a portable archive file manager

Various archive types can be created, extracted, tested, listed, compared,
searched and repacked with patool.

The advantage of patool is its simplicity in handling archive files
without having to remember a myriad of programs and options.

The archive format is determined by the file(1) program and as a fallback
by the archive file extension.

patool supports 7z (.7z), ACE (.ace), ADF (.adf), ALZIP (.alz), APE (.ape),
AR (.a), ARC (.arc), ARJ (.arj), BZIP2 (.bz2), CAB (.cab), COMPRESS (.Z),
CPIO (.cpio), DEB (.deb), DMS (.dms), FLAC (.flac), GZIP (.gz), LRZIP (.lrz),
LZH (.lha, .lzh), LZIP (.lz), LZMA (.lzma), LZOP (.lzo), RPM (.rpm),
RAR (.rar), RZIP (.rz), SHN (.shn), TAR (.tar), XZ (.xz), ZIP (.zip, .jar)
and ZOO (.zoo) formats. It relies on helper applications to handle those
archive formats (for example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).
