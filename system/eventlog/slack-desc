# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

eventlog: EventLog (Syslog API replacement)
eventlog:
eventlog: The EventLog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog()
eventlog: API provided on UNIX systems. The major difference between EventLog
eventlog: and syslog is that EventLog tries to add structure to messages.
eventlog: Where you had a simple non-structrured string in syslog() you have a
eventlog: combination of description and tag/value pairs. EventLog provides an
eventlog: interface to build, format and output an event record.
