This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia
driver.  You also need the nvidia-legacy390-driver package from
SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=4.6.3 ./nvidia-legacy390-kernel.SlackBuild

A default config file is placed at
/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf to make sure that X loads
the nvidia module.  If you need to make changes, copy that file to
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and edit the copy.  You do not need this file
at all if you have a proper and complete xorg.conf.

This script now includes the patches to enable building on newer
kernels.  (MANY thanks to willysr and Herecura for the fixes.)

The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.
