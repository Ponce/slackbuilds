By default, this package will install a modprobe configuration which uses
ipheth-pair as pairing program. Latest libimobiledevice releases ship with a
copy of idevicepair. An alternate modprobe configuration file for the newer
program is shipped too in this folder. If you're going to use it, you may also
want to modify /etc/udev/rules.d/90-iphone-tether.rules and just keep in mind
that this method hasn't been fully tested so YMMV :)
