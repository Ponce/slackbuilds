This is the kernel-module needed by the proprietary binary nvidia
driver.  You also need the nvidia-driver package from SlackBuilds.org.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one,
start the script setting the KERNEL variable as in
    KERNEL=4.6.3 ./nvidia-legacy470-kernel.SlackBuild

A default config file is placed at 
  /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-nvidia.conf
to make sure that X loads the nvidia module.  If you need to make
changes, move that file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ and edit the copy.
You do not need this file at all if you have a proper and complete
xorg.conf.

The xf86-video-nouveau-blacklist package from /extra is required.

The Nvidia 470.xx series is now EOL as of September 2024.

NOTE: To build in -current against the 6.12.x kernel, pass
"CURRENT=yes" to the script.

To build against the 6.14.x kernel in /testing, pass "KERNEL614=yes"
to the script (forces CURRENT=yes).

To build against the 6.15.x or 6.16.x kernels in /testing,
pass "KERNEL615=yes" to the script
(forces KERNEL614=yes and CURRENT=yes).
