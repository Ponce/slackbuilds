suckless-tools (tools from suckless.org)

This is a collection of small tools from tools.suckless.org. They're
bundled together in one build because they're so small and simple.

Included tools:

lsw - List titles of all running X windows to stdout, similar to ls(1).
lsx - List executables in a directory tree [1].
sprop - Simple X property utility.
sselp - Simple X selection printer.
ssid - Simple setsid replacement.
swarp - Simple pointer warping tool for X.
wmname - Print/set window manager name property of the root window [2].
xssstate - A simple tool to retrieve the X screensaver state.

Not included:

dmenu, sandy, sic, slock, svkbd, tabbed - These are packaged separately
on SlackBuilds.org.

9base, ii - Currently not available on SlackBuilds.org. If you package
one of these, please let me know so I can update this README.

[1] lsx would conflict with the /usr/bin/lsx from Slackware's minicom
package. To avoid this, lsx is installed as /usr/bin/lsX. If you don't
use XMODEM (or even know what it is), "rm -f /usr/bin/lsx" before
installing suckless-tools, and /usr/bin/lsx will be a symlink to lsX.

[2] wmname has been packaged separately (as desktop/wmname). This build
gives you the same version of wmname, plus a man page for it, so the
separate wmname build isn't needed.
