suckless-tools (tools from suckless.org)

This is a collection of small tools from tools.suckless.org. They're
bundled together in one build because they're so small and simple.

Included tools:

lsw - List titles of all running X windows to stdout, similar to ls(1).
lsx - List executables in a directory tree [1].
sprop - Simple X property utility.
sselp - Simple X selection printer.
ssid - Simple setsid replacement.
swarp - Simple pointer warping tool for X.
wmname - Print/set window manager name property of the root window [2].
xssstate - A simple tool to retrieve the X screensaver state [3].

Not included:

dmenu, farbfeld, ii, sandy, sent, sic, slock, svkbd, quark, tabbed -
These are packaged separately on SlackBuilds.org.

9base, blind, lchat, scroll, slstatus - Currently not available on
SlackBuilds.org. If you package any of these, please let me know so I
can update this README.

[1] lsx would conflict with the /usr/bin/lsx from Slackware's minicom
package. To avoid this, the suckless-tools lsx is installed as
/usr/bin/lsX. If you don't use XMODEM (or even know what it is), "rm
-f /usr/bin/lsx" before installing suckless-tools, and /usr/bin/lsx
will be a symlink to lsX.

[2] wmname has been packaged separately (as desktop/wmname). This build
gives you the same version of wmname, plus a man page for it, so the
separate wmname build isn't needed.

[3] xssstate has been packaged separately (as desktop/xssstate). It
isn't needed, if you install this package.
