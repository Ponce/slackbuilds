stressapptest (hardware stress test)

Stressful Application Test (or stressapptest, its unix name) is a
memory interface test. It tries to maximize randomized traffic to
memory from processor and I/O, with the intent of creating a realistic
high load situation in order to test the existing hardware devices
in a computer. It has been used at Google for some time and now it is
available under the Apache 2.0 license.
