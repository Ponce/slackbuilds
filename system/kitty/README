kitty (fast, featureful, GPU-based terminal emulator)

kitty is a terminal emulator for X11 and Wayland[1], which offloads
the rendering to the GPU[2] and supports modern terminal features. It
also supports tiling multiple terminal windows without using an extra
program like screen or tmux.

[1] For Wayland support, install wayland-protocols before building
    kitty. It will be auto-detected. It may be necessary to add the
    following line to ~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf:

      linux_display_server wayland

[2] Requires hardware-accelerated OpenGL support.
