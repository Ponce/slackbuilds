arj (Free Software implementation of arj archiver)

A portable version of the ARJ archiver, available for a growing number
of DOS-like and UNIX-like platforms on a variety of architectures.

This build doesn't conflict with Slackware's unarj package. Unlike
unarj, arj is capable of creating archives as well as extracting them.
