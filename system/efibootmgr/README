efibootmgr is a Linux user-space application to modify the Intel Extensible
Firmware Interface (EFI) Boot Manager.  This application can create and
destroy boot entries, change the boot order, change the next running boot
option, and more.

Details on the EFI Boot Manager are available from the EFI Specification,
v1.02 or above, available from:

Note: In order to use this, you'll have to boot your system in EFI mode and
load the "efivars" kernel module:

modprobe efivars
