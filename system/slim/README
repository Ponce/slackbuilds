SLiM is a lightweight login manager based on GNUstep's Login.app. It
makes a great replacement for XDM for those who want something that
looks good, but still do not want Gnome or KDE.

Included is a custom Slackware theme that goes nicely with the lilo boot
theme. Regardless of whether you would like to use the custom theme, you
should see README.SLACKWARE for configuration hints (this file is also
installed into the package's documentation directory).

When at the login screen, select the login session cycling with F1.
