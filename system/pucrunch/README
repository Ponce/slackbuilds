pucrunch (compressor optimized for low-resource decompression)

Pucrunch is a Hybrid LZ77 and RLE compressor, uses an Elias Gamma Code
for lengths, mixture of Gamma Code and linear for LZ77 offset, and
ranked RLE bytes indexed by the same Gamma Code. Uses no extra memory
in decompression.

The compressor can compress/decompress files for C64 (-c64), VIC20
(-c20), C16/+4 (-c16), or for standalone decompressor (-c0).

Assembly sources for example decompressors for Commodore 64 and Nintendo
GameBoy are included.
