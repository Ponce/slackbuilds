This is VHBA (Virtual SCSI Host Bus adapter), a Linux kernel module which 
acts as a low-level SCSI driver and which provides the SCSI layer with a 
virtual SCSI adapter which can have multiple virtual devices.  It is part 
of the userspace-cdemu suite, a free GPL CD/DVD-ROM device emulator for
linux.

NOTE:
The resulting package will be specific for the kernel it was built on.
