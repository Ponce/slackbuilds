Rsyslog is an enhanced syslogd supporting, among others, MySQL, 
PostgreSQL, failover log destinations, syslog/tcp, fine grain output 
format control, high precision timestamps, queued operations and the 
ability to filter on any message part.  It is quite compatible with
stock sysklogd and can be used as a drop-in replacement.  Its advanced 
features make it suitable for enterprise-class, encryption protected 
syslog relay chains while at the same time being very easy to setup 
for the novice user.

Before you can run rsyslog, please see README.SLACKWARE

You can enable a lot of optional (not-autodetected) features by
passing variables to the script (VAR=yes/no ./rsyslog.SlackBuild):
MYSQL=yes|no (default: no), requires mysql (part of stock Slackware)
PGSQL=yes|no (default: no), requires postgresql
RELP=yes|no (default: no), requires librelp
LIBDBI=yes|no (default: no), requires libdbi
GNUTLS=yes|no (default: no), requires gnutls
