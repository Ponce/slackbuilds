cpulimit is a simple program that attempts to limit the cpu usage of a
process (expressed in percentage, not in cpu time). This is useful to
control batch jobs, when you don't want them to eat too much cpu. It does
not act on the nice value or other scheduling priority stuff, but on the
real cpu usage. Also, it is able to adapt itself to the overall system
load, dynamically and quickly.
