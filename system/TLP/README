TLP implements advanced power management for Linux.

It is a command line tool with automated background tasks,
does not contain a GUI.

Remove any power saving settings/scripts (e.g.: in /etc/rc.local), and 
uninstall laptop-mode-tools prior installing or TLP may not work properly.

See README.SLACKWARE for more information about post-installation script.

An additional configuration is available for Thinkpads.
See the website for more details.
