# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

msitools: msitools (Inspect and build Windows Installer (.MSI) files)
msitools:
msitools: msitools is a set of programs to inspect and build
msitools: Windows Installer (.MSI) files. It is based on libmsi, a portable
msitools: library to read and write .MSI files. libmsi in turn is a port of
msitools: (and a subset of) Wine's implementation of the Windows Installer.
