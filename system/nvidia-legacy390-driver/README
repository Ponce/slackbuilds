This is the proprietary binary video driver from NVidia for the X.Org
X-server. This package does not include the kernel module - it is a
part of the nvidia-legacy390-kernel package at SlackBuilds.org.

Installing the 32-bit compatibility libraries is available:
if desired, do:
  COMPAT32="yes" ./nvidia-legacy390-driver.SlackBuild

This script now gives the option of installing the nvidia-persistenced
daemon.  For details see README.nvidia-persistenced.

Several useful utilities are included: nvidia-xsettings, nvidia-smi,
and nvidia-settings.  Please refer to the Nvidia documentation and man
pages for details and usage.

For CUDA/OpenCL to work after reboot, and for utilites such as
nvidia-smi, you might need to include the following line in your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local: (this is REQUIRED for nvidia-persistenced to work
properly)

    # Create missing nvidia device nodes after reboot
    /usr/bin/nvidia-modprobe -c 0 -u

NOTES:
Since nvidia-legacy390-driver conflicts with some files of xorg, it's a
bit complex to install/uninstall the driver.  However, installation of
the nvidia-legacy390-driver package backs up the conflicting files and
puts the nvidia-specific files into place by automatically running
nvidia-switch --install in doinst.sh.

NEW!  This package now includes a douninst.sh script, so it is no
longer necessary to run nvidia-switch --remove before uninstalling or
upgrading.  However, nvidia-switch is still included for use when
xorg-server is upgraded.  Usage of nvidia-switch:

  nvidia-switch --install  <--> save the stock xorg files and
                                install the nvidia symlinks.
  nvidia-switch --remove   <--> remove the nvidia symlinks
                                and restore the stock xorg files.
The affected files are:
/usr/lib[64]/xorg/modules/extensions/libglx.so (xorg-server)
/usr/lib[64]/xorg/modules/libnvidia-wfb.so.1 (nvidia-specific symlink)

If you forget to run nvidia-switch --remove before upgrading
xorg-server, all you need to do is run nvidia-switch --install and all
should be well.

CAUTION!  Please DO NOT USE this script for Slackware(64) versions 14.2
or older as it WILL corrupt the mesa and xorg installations.
Please use the script from those repos instead.
