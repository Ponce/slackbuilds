# nvidia-switch utility 4.0.1
#
# A tool to install and cleanly remove the nvidia driver without
# stomping on the xorg files.  Note: this tool "should" allow switching
# on the fly, but why? Pick a driver! You will still need to edit a bunch
# of other config files.

# TO-DO: needs more cleanup, simplify linking using system tools


# When ROOT=<PATH> is specified when using {install,upgrade,remove}pkg,
# PATH is usually specified without a trailing "/", so we add one here
