BiCon: a Bidirectional Console

BiCon can be used under the Linux console, or terminal emulators with
basic Unicode rendering (UTF-8).

Run "bicon" to get a console supporting Arabic or Persian according to
LANG or specify the country on the command line, for instance:

  bicon ir # for Persian (Iran)

Keymaps and fonts for Arabic and Persian are included. 

Use alt+shift to switch keyboard layouts in a graphical environment.
For more information: "man bicon" and "man bicon.bin".

See also /usr/doc/bicon-<VERSION>/README.Slackware for BiCon's usage.
