Attic is a deduplicating backup program. The main goal of attic 
is to provide an efficient and secure way to backup data. The 
data deduplication technique used makes Attic suitable for daily 
backups since only actual changes are stored.

Optional dependency: llfuse (used for mounting the archives)
