# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ssdeep: ssdeep (program for computing context triggered piecewise hashes)
ssdeep:
ssdeep: ssdeep computes a checksum based on context triggered piecewise
ssdeep: hashes (fuzzy hashes) for each input file.  If requested, the program
ssdeep: matches those checksums against a file of known checksums and reports
ssdeep: any possible matches.  It can also examine one or more of signatures
ssdeep: and find any matches in those signatures.
