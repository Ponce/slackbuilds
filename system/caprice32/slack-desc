# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

caprice32: caprice32 (CPC Emulator)
caprice32:
caprice32: Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home
caprice32: computer series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664,
caprice32: and CPC6128 models. By recreating the operations of all hardware
caprice32: components at a low level, the emulator achieves a high degree of
caprice32: compatibility with original CPC software. These programs or games can
caprice32: be run unmodified at real-time or higher speeds, depending on the
caprice32: emulator host environment.
