Anything-sync-daemon (asd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage user 
specified directories referred to as sync targets from here on out, in tmpfs and 
to periodically sync them back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is 
accomplished via a symlinking step and an innovative use of rsync to maintain 
synchronization between a tmpfs copy and media-bound backups. Additionally, asd 
features several crash recovery features.
