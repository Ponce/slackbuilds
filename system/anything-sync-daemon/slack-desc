# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

anything-sync-daemon: anything-sync-daemon (Manage directories in tmpfs)
anything-sync-daemon:
anything-sync-daemon: Anything-sync-daemonAUR (asd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to
anything-sync-daemon: manage user specified directories referred to as sync targets from
anything-sync-daemon: here on out, in tmpfs and to periodically sync them back to the
anything-sync-daemon: physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished via a symlinking step
anything-sync-daemon: and an innovative use of rsync to maintain synchronization between
anything-sync-daemon: a tmpfs copy and media-bound backups.
