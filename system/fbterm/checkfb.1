.SH NAME
checkfb \- check for the existence of a framebuffer device
.\" RST source for checkfb(1) man page. Convert with:
.
.\" rst2man.py checkfb.rst > checkfb.1
.
.\" rst2man.py comes from the SBo development/docutils package.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
checkfb <[\fIdevice\fP]>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
checkfb attempts to open the Linux framebuffer device read\-only. If successful,
it reports the display resolution and bit depth.
.sp
By default, it opens \fB/dev/fb0\fP\&. The \fIdevice\fP option overrides this.
.sp
There are no options.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
0 (success) if the framebuffer exists and can be opened.
.sp
Non\-zero means failure: the device doesn\(aqt exist, the permissions
don\(aqt allow opening it, or possibly the kernel doesn\(aqt support
framebuffer devices at all.
.SH EXAMPLES

.INDENT 3.5
