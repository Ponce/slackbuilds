-----------------------------------------------
check for the existence of a framebuffer device

SYNOPSIS
========

checkfb <[*device*]>

DESCRIPTION
===========

checkfb attempts to open the Linux framebuffer device read-only. If successful,
it reports the display resolution and bit depth.

By default, it opens **/dev/fb0**. The *device* option overrides this.

There are no options.

EXIT STATUS
===========

0 (success) if the framebuffer exists and can be opened.

Non-zero means failure: the device doesn't exist, the permissions
don't allow opening it, or possibly the kernel doesn't support
framebuffer devices at all.

EXAMPLES
========

::

  # checkfb
  The framebuffer device (/dev/fb0) was opened successfully.
  1920x1080, 32bpp
  The framebuffer device was mapped to memory successfully.

=========
