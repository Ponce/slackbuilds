FbTerm is a fast terminal emulator for linux with the frame buffer device
or a VESA video card.

fbterm supports the mouse (provided gpm is running) and is able to
share the console with (some) other applications, such as "mplayer -vo
fbdev2". It also uses the same fonts as X, and renders them with lovely
antialiasing like modern X terminals. fbterm has *much* better Unicode
support than the plain Linux framebuffer console.

Also included is a handy utility called checkfb, which simply checks
for the presence and usability of the framebuffer device, and shows its
resolution and bit depth.

This package uses POSIX filesystem capabilities to execute with
elevated privileges (required for keyboard shortcuts and console
redirection). This may be considered a security risk. Please read
http://www.slackbuilds.org/caps/ for more information. To disable
capabilities, pass SETCAP=no to the script. See also the SECURITY
NOTES section in the fbterm man page.
