LIRC is a package that allows you to decode and send infra-red signals
of many (but not all) commonly used remote controls.

Former versions focussed on home-brew hardware connected to the serial
or parallel port. Current versions of LIRC also support a variety of
other hardware.

NOTE: for FTDI chips support you need install libftdi and ftdi_eeprom
from http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/ before running the
SlackBuild.
