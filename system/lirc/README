LIRC is a package that allows you to decode and send infra-red signals of many
(but not all) commonly used remote controls.

Former versions focussed on home-brew hardware connected to the serial or
parallel port. Current versions of LIRC also support a variety of other
hardware.

NOTE: for FTDI chips support you need install libftdi and ftdi_eeprom from
http://www.intra2net.com/en/developer/libftdi/
before running the slackbuild.
