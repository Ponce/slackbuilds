cantarell-fonts (The Cantarell typeface family is a contemporary Humanist sans serif, and is
used by the GNOME project for its user interface and the Fedora project.)

Cantarell was originally designed by Dave Crossland as part of his coursework for the MA Typeface
Design programme at the Department of Typography in the University of Reading, England.

This is the open font officially chosen by default for the GNOME 3 desktop and for Fedora branding materials.
