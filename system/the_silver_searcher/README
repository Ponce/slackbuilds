Ag is a code searching tool similar to grep and ack, but with a focus on speed.

Ag searches code about 3-5x faster than ack. It ignores file patterns from your
.gitignore and .hgignore. If there are files in your source repo you don't want
to search, just add their patterns to a .agignore file. The command name is 33%
shorter than ack!
