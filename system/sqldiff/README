The sqldiff binary is a command-line utility program that displays
the differences between SQLite databases.

Example usage:
sqldiff [options] database1.sqlite database2.sqlite

The usual output is an SQL script that will transform database1.sqlite
(the "source" database) into database2.sqlite (the "destination" database).


sqldiff is part of SQLite, it comes inside the tools directory of
the SQLite sources. It isn't included in the stock slackware SQLite package.
Hence this SlackBuild follows the Slackware SQLite version and compilation options.
This is why the source used are linked from Slackware mirrors, to ensure
maximum compatibility with stock Slackware.
