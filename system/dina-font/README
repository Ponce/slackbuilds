dina-font (a monospace bitmap font aimed at programmers)

Dina is a monospace bitmap font, primarily aimed at programmers. It is
relatively compact to allow a lot of code on screen while clear enough
to remain readable even at high resolutions.

After the package is installed, X applications using fontconfig will be
able to use the Dina fonts right away. To make them visible to old-style X
apps (such as xterm), run "xset fp rehash" in your X session. After that,
try e.g. "xterm -fn Dina_10" (Dina_6, Dina_8, Dina_9 are also available).

Optionally, console fonts can be included in the package. To do this,
install psftools before running this SlackBuild. To view the fonts, use
e.g. "setfont Dina_10" (or Dina_6, Dina_8, Dina_9). To use as the system
default, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.font and change the setfont line there. Don't
forget that rc.font needs to be executable.

The X11 fonts use the Windows-1252 character set (compatible with
Latin-1). The console fonts are available in Windows-1252, codepage 437,
and codepage 850.
