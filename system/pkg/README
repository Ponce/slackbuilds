`pkg` Simple and fast package manager for the Slackbuilds.org repository

Can download, build and install packages. Resolves dependencies and
manages the installed packages and blacklist. Can search for packages,
and display them and their dependencies/dependees.

It differs from many other package managers in that you can simply
specify the packages you actually use in /etc/pkg/pkg_list.txt and the
(possibly changing) dependencies are managed automatically.

Written in go, it is fast and lightweight and can easily be
configured by changing src/config.go and recompiling.

Read README.md of the actual package for more information on how to use
it.
