# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

hebe:
hebe: Hebe is a KDE front-end GUI for the Hercules z/Arch emulator. It was
hebe: designed to have a modern look; there are no dials! Hebe provides two
hebe: consoles, one for Hercules and one for the SCP (system control
hebe: program), AKA, the operating system. Input is automatically routed to
hebe: the correct receiver. You can start as many instances of Hercules as
hebe: your hardware can support.
