xautomation contains tools to control the X server from the command line.

The tools will be useful for scripting, and for doing "visual scraping"
to find things on the screen. These programs allow scripted mouse movement,
clicking, button up/down, key up/down, etc., and use the XTest extension.
The visgrep program finds images inside of images and reports their coordinates.
