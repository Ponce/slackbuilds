fswatch is a cross-platform file change monitor that receives notifications
when the contents of the specified files or directories are modified.

The fswatch.SlackBuild automatically builds the linux variant of fswatch.

If you would like to compile fswatch for another OS, please check the README
files that will be saved to /usr/doc/fswatch-${VERSION}/

The default compiler is clang++ however, if you prefer, fswatch can also be
compiled with g++:

   CXX="g++" ./fswatch.SlackBuild
