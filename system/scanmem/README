scanmem is a debugging utility designed to isolate the address of an arbitrary
variable in an executing process. scanmem simply needs to be told the pid of
the process, and the value of the variable at several different times.

After several scans of the process, scanmem isolates the position of the
variable and allows you to modify it's value.
