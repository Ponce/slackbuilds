Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
Internet.

This build script should build a package that "just works" after install.
You will need to specify a two-letter country code (such as "us") as an
argument to the COUNTRY variable when running the build script (this will
default to "us" if nothing is specified).  For example:
  COUNTRY=nl ./clamav.SlackBuild

You need a "clamav" user and group - we suggest uid=210 and gid=210.

See README.SLACKWARE for configuration help.
