glances is a free (LGPL) cross-platform curses-based system monitoring tool
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional data as it can
adapt the displayed information dynamically, depending on the terminal size.

This tool can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring can be done
via terminal or web interface.

glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch statistical
values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory, network, disks,
file systems, processes, etc.
