glances is a free (LGPL) cross-platform curses-based system monitoring tool
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space, ideally
to fit in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional data as it can
adapt the displayed information dynamically, depending on the terminal size.

This tool can also work in client/server mode. Remote monitoring can be done
via terminal or web interface.

glances is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch statistical
values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory, network, disks,
file systems, processes, etc.

OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES

Available on SBo: batinfo (battery monitoring support), bottle (Web server
mode), hddtemp (HHD temperature monitoring support), matplotlib (generation
of graphs from history data), netifaces (auto discoverer mode), py3sensors
(HW monitoring support), pymdstat (RAID support), python3, statsd (StatsD
export module), ysnmp (SNMP support).

Not available on SBo: docker-py (Docker monitoring support), influxdb (InfluxDB
export module), pika (RabbitMQ/ActiveMQ export module), pystache (action script
feature), zeroconf (auto discoverer mode).

NOTES

1) When launching glances in a terminal with a bright background, the option
'--theme-white' is recommended.

2) For optional auto discoverer mode, both zeroconf and netifaces are needed.
