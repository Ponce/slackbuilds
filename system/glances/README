Glances is a free (LGPL) cross-platform curses-based monitoring tool,
which aims to present a maximum of information in a minimum of space
and ideally fits in a classical 80x24 terminal, or larger for additional
information.

Glances can adapt dynamically the displayed information depending on
the terminal size. It can also work in a client/server mode for remote
monitoring.

This tool is written in Python and uses the psutil library to fetch the
statistical values from key elements, like CPU, load average, memory,
network, disks, file systems, processes, etc.

Optional dependencies are Jinja2 (for HTML output), hddtemp (for HHD
temperature monitoring support) and python3.
Others not available on SBo are pysensors (for HW monitoring support)
and batinfo (for battery monitoring support).
