csvutils (inspect and manipulate CSV data)

csvutils is a set of command-line utilities that use libcsv to access
comma (or actually, any delimiter) separated data files. Included
programs:

csvcount - print the number of fields and rows in CSV files.
csvcheck - determine the validity of CSV data.
csvfix   - convert malformed CSV data into well formed data, and convert
           to CSV data with different quotes and/or delimiters.
csvgrep  - search specific fields of CSV data for a pattern.
csvcut   - output only the specified fields of a CSV file.
csvbreak - break a file into multiple pieces based on the value of the
           specified field.

Each utility has a man page.
