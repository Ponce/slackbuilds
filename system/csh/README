csh (C shell from BSD)

The C shell was originally written at UCB to overcome limitations in
the Bourne shell. Its flexibility and comfort (at that time) quickly
made it the shell of choice until more advanced shells like ksh, bash,
zsh or tcsh appeared. Most of the latter incorporate features original
to csh.

This build is based on OpenBSD sources from 2011.

For Slackware-specific details about this build of csh, see the file
README_Slackware.txt. Seriously, really, read it.
