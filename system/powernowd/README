This is a very simple program that will adjust the speed of your CPU
depending on system load.

It is designed for use with CPU's supporting AMD's PowerNow power
management scheme, as it's algorithm works better if there are more then
two CPU speeds available.  (aka, ARM, AMD K6/K7, Via C3, and Crusoe as
opposed to traditional Intel and Ultrasparc).

This program is essentially a simple client to the CPUFreq sysfs
interface.  This means that you -need- to be running Linux v2.5 or later
that includes the sysfs interface.
