Rover is a file browser for the terminal.

The main goal is to provide a faster way to explore a file system from
the terminal, compared to what's possible by using cd, ls, etc. Rover
has vi-like key bindings for navigation and can open files in $PAGER
and $EDITOR. Basic file system operations are also implemented Rover 
is designed to be simple, fast and portable.

place it in the config directory before running the script.
