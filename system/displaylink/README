Driver for DisplayLink devices.

This SlackBuild is a binary repackaging. To download the "source", you
must navigate to download URL and accept the license.

Another option is to use the following command:

wget https://www.synaptics.com/sites/default/files/exe_files/2021-02/DisplayLink%20USB%20Graphics%20Software%20for%20Ubuntu1.4-EXE.zip

Note that this command may stop working at some point, if Synaptics
changes the layout of their web site. Also note that this is
proprietary software with a non-free license. Using wget does not
exempt you from the license terms.
