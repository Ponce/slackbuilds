k3s (Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution)

k3s is a lightweight, fully compliant Kubernetes distribution designed
for constrained environments such as edge computing, IoT devices, and
development setups. Created by Rancher Labs, k3s aims to simplify the
deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters.


The following can be used to start/stop k3s automatically:
/etc/rc.d/rc.k3s
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.k3s ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.k3s start
  fi

/etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.k3s ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.k3s stop
  fi
