fsv (3D file system viewer, Jurassic Park style)

fsv (pronounced eff-ess-vee) is a file system visualizer in cyberspace. It
lays out files and directories in three dimensions, geometrically
representing the file system hierarchy to allow visual overview and
analysis. fsv can visualize a modest home directory, a workstation's
hard drive, or any arbitrarily large collection of files, limited only
by the host computer's memory and graphics hardware.
