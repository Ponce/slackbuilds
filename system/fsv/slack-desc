# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fsv: fsv (pronounced eff-ess-vee) is a file system visualizer in
fsv: cyberspace. It lays out files and directories in three dimensions,
fsv: geometrically representing the file system hierarchy to allow visual
fsv: overview and analysis. fsv can visualize a modest home directory, a
fsv: workstation's hard drive, or any arbitrarily large collection of
fsv: files limited only by the host computer's memory and graphics
fsv: hardware.
