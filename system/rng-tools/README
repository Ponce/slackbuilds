rng-tools provide rngd and rngtest.

rngd supplies data from a hardware RNG to the kernel's entropy pool. To ensure
sufficient randomness, rngd verifies the RNGs data using FIPS 140-1 / 140-2
randomness tests, before passing them to the kernel.

rngtest is a standalone tool for running the FIPS tests over data.
