hungrycat ('cat' and 'rm' in a single tool)

hungrycat is a tool that prints contents of a file on the standard
output, while simultaneously freeing disk space occupied by the
file. It can be useful if you need to process a large file, but you
don't have enough space to store the output file and you wouldn't need
the input file afterwards.
