AppArmor protects systems from insecure or untrusted processes by running them
in restricted confinement, while still allowing processes to share files,
exercise privilege and communicate with other processes. AppArmor is a
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism which uses the Linux Security Module
(LSM) framework.

Note that in order to use AppArmor, you need to have CONFIG_SECURITY_APPARMOR
setting enabled in the kernel (which is not enabled by default in Slackware).
So in order to use this, you need to reconfigure & recompile your kernel.
