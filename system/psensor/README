Psensor is a graphical hardware temperature monitoring tool for Linux
that allows users to monitor the temperature of various components such
as CPU, GPU, and hard drives in real-time. It provides visual
representations of temperature data through graphs and notifications
when temperatures exceed predefined thresholds.

Psensor can also log historical temperature data for analysis and
supports sensors from various sources, including lm-sensors and hddtemp.
The application is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible
for both novice and experienced users who want to keep track of their
system's thermal performance.

libxnvctrl is only needed if you have an NVIDIA card. See README.NVIDIA
for more information.
