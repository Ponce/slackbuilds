autojump is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by
maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the
command line. The jumpstat command shows you the current contents
of the database. You need to work a little bit before the database
becomes usable. Autojump will listen and rank your 'cd' commands by
frequency. Once your database is reasonably complete, you can "jump"
to a commonly "cd"ed directory.  It supports the bash, zsh, and
tcsh shells.

Installation
------------

Add the following to your .bashrc so that autojump commands will
be recognized:

source /etc/profile.d/autojump.bash

Next, open a new shell and execute:

$ cd /tmp
$ cd /home
$ cd /var
$ j tmp

You should be dropped back into the /tmp directory.  You can activate
autojump for other shells by changing the sourced file extension to
a supported shell name.
