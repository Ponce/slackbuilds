Dieharder is a random number generator (RNG) testing suite, designed
to make it easy to time and test RNGs implemented in both software and
hardware.  It makes extensive use of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL),
and includes a battery of pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) and
testing algorithms for research and cryptographic applications.

The software saw its last release in 2011, and patches are applied
mostly to overcome differences with newer versions of autoconf.  This
build installs the dieharder program as well as the libdieharder
shared libraries that can be called from your program code.

If you have latex2html installed and want the PDF manual, execute the
build script like so: PDFMAN=yes ./dieharder.SlackBuild
