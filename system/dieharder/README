Dieharder is a random number generator (RNG) testing suite, designed to make
it easy to time and test RNGs implemented in both software and hardware.  It
makes extensive use of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL), and includes a
battery of pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) and testing algorithms for
research and cryptographic applications.

The software saw its last release in 2011, and differences with newer versions
of autoconf are starting to become apparent.  Patches are applied mostly to
overcome these differences, as well as one trivial fix to appease C99.  The
build installs the dieharder software as well as the libdieharder libraries
that can be called from your program code.
