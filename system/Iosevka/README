Iosevka is a slender monospace, sans-serif and slab-serif typeface
inspired by Pragmata Pro, M+ and PF DIN Mono, designed to be the
ideal font for programming.

- Four styles: Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic;
- Extended language support for most Latin-based Western, Central and
Northern European languages, as well as Greek and Cyrillic.

This Slackbuild installs two versions of fonts: Iosevka and
Iosevka-slab.
