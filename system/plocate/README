plocate (a much faster locate)

plocate is a locate based on posting lists. Compared to mlocate,
it is much faster, and its index is much smaller. updatedb speed is
similar (or you can convert mlocate's index to plocate format using
plocate-build). It supports most mlocate options; see --help or the
man page for more information.

This replaces Slackware's mlocate. Technically, there's no conflict,
but it's redundant to have both plocate and mlocate installed, so you
should 'removepkg mlocate' before installing this (and add mlocate to
/etc/slackpkg/blacklist).
