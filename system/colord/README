colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install
and generate color profiles to accurately color manage input
and output devices.

This requires a colord user/group to be added:
groupadd -g 303 colord
useradd -d /var/lib/colord -u 303 -g colord -s /bin/false colord

This package can optionally add bash completion support by running:
BASH_COMPLETION=yes ./colord.SlackBuild

If you want argyllcms support (new dep: argyllcms), use:
ARGYLL=yes ./colord.SlackBuild

Optional dependency: vala
