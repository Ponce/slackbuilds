Gigolo is a frontend to easily manage connections to remote filesystems 
using GIO/GVfs. It allows you to quickly connect/mount remote filesystems 
and manage bookmarks of such.

This script installs a compatibility wrapper to /usr/bin/gnome-mount
unless you pass something other than "yes" to GNOMEMOUNT when running
the build script, e.g. GNOMEMOUNT=no ./gigolo.SlackBuild

Gvfs is an optional (but highly recommended) run-time dependency.
