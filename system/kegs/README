KEGS (Kent's Emulated GS)

KEGS is an Apple IIgs emulator for Mac OS X, Linux, and Win32. The Apple
IIgs was the most powerful computer in the Apple II line. It first was
sold in 1986. An Apple IIgs has the capability to run almost all Apple
II, Apple IIe, and Apple IIc programs.

KEGS requires a ROM image dumped from an Apple IIgs. This will typically
be called either "rom01" (131072 bytes) or "rom03" (262144 bytes),
and will often be distributed in zip files called apple2g1.zip and
apple2gs.zip (for use with MESS). This package can optionally include
the ROM file. To do this, place the ROM image in the slackbuild
directory before running the script. The image will be installed
as /usr/share/kegs/rom03 (or rom01). If you do not include the ROM
in the package, you will need to manually copy the rom03 image to
/usr/share/kegs/rom03 before the emulator will work properly.

Optional dependency: If you intend to run Apple's GS/OS in
the emulator, you will need macutils to extract the .sea.bin
archives from Apple's website. Download disk image(s) from
http://www.info.apple.com/support/oldersoftwarelist.html and then
run e.g.:

$ macunpack -d Disk_2_of_7-System.Disk.sea.bin
$ mv Disk_2_of_7-System.Disk.data system_disk.dsk

Mount system_disk.dsk on slot 5 using the config menu within xkegs,
set slot 5 as the default startup device in the IIgs control panel,
and you should be booting into the IIgs native GUI environment.
