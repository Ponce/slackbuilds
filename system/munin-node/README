munin-node is the client portion of the Munin Monitoring system. It allows the 
Munin master to collect statistics for presentation in RRDTool time-series
graphs.

munin-node is a Perl application and requires several Perl modules as external
dependencies:

	Net::Server

Additionally, the following modules are required for some plugins:

	Net::SSLeay (for SSL connections)
	Net::SNMP
	Net::CIDR

Munin requires that user munin exists and belongs to group munin. Create these
before running the SlackBuild script:

groupadd -g 308 munin
useradd -u 308 -g 308 -s /sbin/nologin munin

Once munin-node is installed, configure plugins per the Munin documentation.
