========================================================================

This is the GNOME terminal emulator application.  gnome-terminal is    
only the shell (menubar, prefs dialog); the terminal emulation ("stuff 
in the middle") comes from the VTE widget.

How it works:

Profiles - 
  all settings are stored in profiles. prefs dialog edits the current
  profile

Session - 
  just the number of open windows/tabs and their profile is stored
  per-session
 
Command line options - 
  do not overlap things that are preferences
  
========================================================================

POST INSTALL RUN:

bash# killall gconfd-2

The terminal doesn't launch until that is done.
Have no idea why, if you do please let me know =D
