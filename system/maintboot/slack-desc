# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

maintboot:
maintboot: maintboot runs commands outside of the current OS, with exclusive
maintboot: access to the system and hardware. This can be useful to run
maintboot: maintenance tasks, like repartitioning, in a controlled environment.
maintboot: Maintboot builds an appliance on the fly from a list of packages
maintboot: (using supermin). It then loads the appliance with kexec, bypassing
maintboot: the bios, and runs the maintenance script in that new context.
