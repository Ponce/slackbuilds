Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups
around the world who use the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality
publications.  It supports a wide range of Latin-based alphabets and includes
glyphs that correspond to all the Latin ranges of Unicode.

The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
attractive.  The additional ‘extended’ Latin letters are designed to naturally
harmonize with the traditional 26 ones.  Diacritics are treated with careful
thought and attention to their use.  Gentium also supports both polytonic and
monotonic Greek, including a number of alternate forms.  These fonts were
originally the product of two years of research and study by the designer at
the University of Reading, England, as part of an MA program in Typeface
Design.
