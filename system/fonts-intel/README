Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family
that’s built with clarity, legibility, and the needs
of developers in mind.It’s easier to read, and
available for free, with an open-source font license.
Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200
languages using the Latin script. The Intel One Mono
fonts are provided in four weights — Light, Regular,
Medium, and Bold — with matching italics.

Clear Sans has been recognized as a versatile OpenType
font for screen, print, and Web. It was designed with
on-screen legibility in mind and strikes a balance
between contemporary, professional, and stylish
expression and thoroughly functional purpose. It has a
sophisticated and elegant personality at all sizes,
and its thoughtful design becomes even more
evident at the thin weight.

Clear Sans has minimized, unambiguous characters and
slightly narrow proportions, making it ideal for UI design.
Its strong, recognizable forms avoid distracting ambiguity,
making it comfortable for reading short UI labels and long
passages in both screen and print.

This font supports a wide range of languages using Latin,
Cyrillic, and Greek scripts. The font family includes medium,
regular, thin, and light weights with upright, italic, and bold styles.
