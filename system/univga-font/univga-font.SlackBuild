# Slackware build script for univga-font

# Written by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# VERSION taken from the datestamp of the tarball.

# 20201206 bkw: BUILD=3, added OTB font since -current's pango wants it.
#               Also add PCF (disabled by default). Based on a patch from
#               Tomasz Bywalec. Update README. Have slack-desc list the
#               font types included in the package.

# 20191224 bkw: BUILD=2, xset fp rehash in doinst.sh.
