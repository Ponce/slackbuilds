ckb-next is an open-source driver for Corsair keyboards and mice. It
aims to bring the features of Corsair's proprietary CUE software
to Linux operating systems. This project is currently a work in
progress, but it already supports much of the same functionality,
including full RGB animations.

ckb-next requires a background daemon (ckb-next-daemon) to
communicate with Corsair keyboards and mice. Slackware does not
start this daemon automatically, so you must enable it manually.
To start or stop the ckb-next daemon automatically at boot, add the
following to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.ckb-next ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.ckb-next start
fi
