With SMB for Fuse you can seamlessly browse your network neighbourhood
as were it on your own filesystem.

It's basically smbmount with a twist. Instead of mounting one Samba share
at a time, you mount all workgroups, hosts and shares at once. Only when
you're accessing a share a connection is made to the remote computer.
