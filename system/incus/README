Incus is a next generation system container and virtual
machine manager.

Incus, which is named after the Cumulonimbus incus or anvil
cloud started as community fork of Canonical's LXD following
Canonical's takeover of the LXD project from the Linux Containers
community.

The project was then adopted by the Linux Containers community,
taking back the spot left empty by LXD's departure.

Incus is a true open source community project, free of any CLA
and remains released under the Apache 2.0 license. It is
maintained by the same team of developers that first created LXD.

LXD users wishing to migrate to Incus can easily do so
through a migration tool called lxd-to-incus.


The incusd server runs as root with client access via various
"incus" commands. A particular user group can be assigned
whose members are able run incus commands without becoming root.
The default group is wheel but a different group may be used,
as desired, by setting the INCUSD_GROUP environment variable
when running this SlackBuild
e.g.
    INCUSD_GROUP=incus-admin bash incus.SlackBuild
In this case, users belonging to the incus-admin group are able
to run incus commands successfully. The incus-admin group does
not exist in a default Slackware installation so it would need
to have been already created.

To start incusd by hand, ensure that the /etc/rc.d/rc.incusd
file is executable and then run:
  /etc/rc.d/rc.incusd start
To start incusd automatically whenever the system boots, add
the following snippet to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

# Start incusd
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.incusd ]; then
  . /etc/rc.d/rc.incusd start
fi

When running incusd for the first time, set up the basic working
environment by running the terminal command:
    incus admin init

From version 6.18 (build 2), the web based UI is available
separately via the incus-ui package (64bit only).
