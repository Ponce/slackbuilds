nmon (Nigel's performance MONitor)

This systems administrator, tuner, benchmark tool gives you a huge
amount of important performance information in one go. It can output
the data in different ways.
You can display the CPU, memory, network, disks (mini graphs or numbers),
file systems, NFS, top processes, resources. Save the data to a comma
separated file for analysis and longer term data capture. Directly put
your data into rrd database.

Using export NMON=$(parms) you can change the default view.
