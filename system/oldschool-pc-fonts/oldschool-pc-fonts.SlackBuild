# Now maintained by B. Watson <yalhcru@gmail.com>

# 20201207 bkw:
# - Update for v2.2. Enough changes that we can't build the old version with
#   the modified script.
# - Include all upstream's documentation.
# - Include OTB fonts, now that they exist.
# - gzip the .psfu fonts.

# 20180108 bkw:
# - Take over maintenance.
# - BUILD=2.
# - Include console fonts, if psftools is installed.
# - Add variables TTF and CONSOLE to control which fonts are installed.
# - A bit of useful documentation in README_console.txt.
