rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing things.
rdup itself does not backup anything. It only prints a list of files
that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump. It also handles
files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental backups.

Optional dependency is nettle (to provide encryption for rdup-tr).
