rename.pl (rename multiple files, perl style)

Rename.pl renames the filenames supplied according to the rule
specified as the first argument. The argument is a Perl expression
which is expected to modify the $_ string for at least some of the
filenames specified.

This replaces the system/perl-rename that was formerly available.

See also: system/rename (Python version), system/mmv.
