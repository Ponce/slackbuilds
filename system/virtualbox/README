VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

You have to create a vboxusers group, e.g. "groupadd -g 215 vboxusers"
and make your user a member of that group.

To enable the webservice pass WEBSERVICE=yes to the script. This will
require gsoap as optional dependency.

If you want to build the java bindings, pass JAVA=yes to the script.
This will require zulu-openjdk8 as optional dependency.

On x86_64, this by default builds without software virtualization. This
means you need hardware virtualization in order to run 32bit guests on
64bit hosts. To enable software virtualization, pass
SOFTWARE_VIRTUALIZATION=yes to the script. Note that this will require
a compiler that can generate 32bit code, and thus will not build on a
stock x86_64 system. This switch has no effect on x86 systems.

If you want to attach VirtualBox to a VDE network you will need vde2.

See README.SLACKWARE for some setup notes.
