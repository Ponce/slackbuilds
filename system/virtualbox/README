VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

By default VirtualBox will be compiled with hardening enabled. That
means all binaries will be run suid root, which is the default
behaviour of upstream packages. However, you are still able
to disable this by passing HARDENING=no to the script.

You have to create a vboxusers group, e.g. "groupadd -g 215 vboxusers"
and make your user a member of that group.

To compile a headless virtualbox pass HEADLESS=yes to the script.

To enable the webservice pass WEBSERVICE=yes to the script. This will
require gsoap as optional dependency.

If you want to build the java bindings, pass JAVA=yes to the script.
This will require jdk as optional dependency.

If you want to attach VirtualBox to a VDE network you will need vde2.

See README.SLACKWARE for some setup notes.

NOTE: This will not build on a stock x86_64 system.
