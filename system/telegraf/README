telegraf (An Open-Source Collecting & Reporting Agent)

It is part of the TICK stack and is a plugin-driven server agent for
collecting and reporting metrics. Telegraf has plugins or integrations
to source a variety of metrics directly from the system it’s running
on, pull metrics from third-party APIs, or even listen for metrics via
a StatsD and Kafka consumer services. It also has output plugins to
send metrics to a variety of other datastores, services, and message
queues, including InfluxDB, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Datadog, Librato,
Kafka, MQTT, NSQ, and many others.
