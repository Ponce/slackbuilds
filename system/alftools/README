alftools (Atari 8-bit ALF archive tools)

alftools is a compressor and decompressor for the ALF archive file
format, as used on the Atari 8-bit computers in the late 1980s.

The binaries are 'alf' and 'unalf', and each has its own man page.

Also included: "magic" for the file(1) command, so it can identify
ALF archives. Example:

$ file infocom1.alf
infocom1.alf: Atari 8-bit AlfCrunch data, first filename CUTHROAT.
