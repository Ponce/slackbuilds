influxdb (An Open-Source Time Series Database)

InfluxDB is an open source time series database with no external dependencies.
It's useful for recording metrics, events, and performing analytics.

It supports high write loads, large data set storage, and conserves space thru
downsampling, automatically expiring and deleting unwanted data as well as
backup and restore. InfluxDB also makes it easy to analyze data by providing an
easy-to-use SQL-like query language.
