ZFS is a modern filesystem originally developed for SOLARIS.
It provides many functionalities such as snapshots, data compression,
data recovery, filesystem (snapshot) sending/reveiving, and more.

For more information about ZFS on Linux, please visit

NOTE: You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this.
This package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it for
every new kernel you choose to run.

Please use KERN environment variable if target kernel version differs
from that's of the build machine, e.g. `export KERN=5.4.51`.

NOTE: you should run ZFS on 64-bit systems.
