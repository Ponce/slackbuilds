ZFS is a modern filesystem originally developed for SOLARIS.
It provides many functionalities such as snapshots, data compression,
data recovery and many more.

You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this.
This package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it
for every new kernel you choose to run.

If you don't have a /usr/src/linux symlink pointing to your real
kernel directory (the script looks for it there by default), specify
your kernel source destination by

  LINUXPATH=<path to your kernel source> ./zfs-on-linux.SlackBuild

NOTE: you should run this on x86_64 systems.
