Conky is a system monitor for X originally based on the torsmo code.
Since its original conception, Conky has changed a fair bit from
its predecessor.  Conky can display just about anything, either on
your root desktop or in its own window.  Conky has many built-in
objects, as well as the ability to execute programs and scripts, then
display the output from stdout.

Audacious is disabled by default because it requires libaudclient.
libaudclient is available here at SBo.  You can enable audacious
support in the build by passing AUDACIOUS=yes ./conky.SlackBuild.

If you are using the binary Nvidia drivers, conky has native support
for monitoring your video cards hardware.  To enable this feature,
you must install the binary drivers using the nvidia_kernel and
nvidia_driver packages available here at SBo, or you can use the
binary run installer provided by Nvidia. Once the driver is
installed, you must install libxnvctrl, also available at SBo.
Then pass NVIDIA=yes to the build script.
