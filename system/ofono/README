oFono provides a mobile telephony (GSM/UMTS) application development 
framework that includes consistent, minimal, and easy to use complete APIs. 

As an open source project, it includes a high-level D-Bus API for use by 
telephony applications of any license. oFono also includes a low-level 
plug-in API for integrating with open source as well as third party 
telephony stacks, cellular modems, and storage back ends. 

The plug-in API functionality is modeled on public standards, in 
particular 3GPP TS 27.007 "AT command set for User Equipment (UE)." 

oFono is sponsored by Intel and most of the project maintainers work.
