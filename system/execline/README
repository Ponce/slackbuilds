execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh ; but its
syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The
execlineb program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text
file; the other commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb
script.

execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile,
its syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax,
and has no security issues.

execline requires skalibs at build time but not at run time.

execline installs into /command to match the skarnet.org examples.
