The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by Ascender's
Steve Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a set of system
fonts for its Android platform.  The goal was to provide optimal quality
and comfort on a mobile handset when rendered in application menus, web
browsers, and for other screen text.

This package installs /etc/fonts/conf.avail/35-droid.conf which sets the
"sans" and "serif" and "monospace" aliases to Droid fonts.  If you want
to use Droid as your system fonts, symlink it into /etc/fonts/conf.d/
