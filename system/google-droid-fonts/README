The Droid typeface family was designed in the fall of 2006 by
Ascender's Steve Matteson, as a commission from Google to create a
set of system fonts for its Android platform.  The goal was to provide
optimal quality and comfort on a mobile handset when rendered in
application menus, web browsers, and for other screen text.

This SlackBuild puts 35-droid.conf into /etc/fonts/conf.avail. 
It sets the "sans", "serif" and "monospace" aliases to Droid fonts. 
If you want to use Droid as your system fonts, symlink it into
/etc/fonts/conf.d.
