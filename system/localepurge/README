localepurge (remove superfluous locale data)

localepurge removes superfluous locale data from your system. It is
a small script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locale files
and localized man pages.

This is a script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded locales,
Gnome/KDE localizations and localized man pages. Depending on the
installation, it is possible to save some 200, 300, or even more
megabytes of disk space dedicated to localization you will most
probably never have any use for.

Before use of localepurge, please edit /etc/locale.nopurge and comment
out the line: NEEDSCONFIGFIRST.
