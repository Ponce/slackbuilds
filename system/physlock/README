Control physical access to a linux computer by locking all of its
virtual terminals / consoles.

physlock is an alternative to vlock, it is equivalent to `vlock -an'.
It is written because vlock blocks some linux kernel mechanisms like
hibernate and suspend and can therefore only be used with some
limitations. physlock is designed to be more lightweight, it does not
have a plugin interface and it is not started using a shell script
wrapper.
