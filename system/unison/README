Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two
replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different
hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then
brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with updates
to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates that do not
conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and
displayed.

Unison allows you to either build a text-only binary or a binary that will
use a graphical user interface.

By default this slackbuild will, similar to Slackware's own emacs package,
build both a text-only and a gui binary. To do this (which is the default):

  "FLAVOUR='gtk2 text' ./unison.SlackBuild" or just "./unison.SlackBuild"

To only build a text only binary, do this:

  "FLAVOUR=text ./unison.SlackBuild"

To only build a gui only binary, do this:

  "FLAVOUR=gtk2 ./unison.SlackBuild"

hevea is an optional dependency which allows building the HTML documentation.
Otherwise only a version as PDF will be built.
