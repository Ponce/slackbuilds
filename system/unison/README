Unison is a file-synchronization tool for Unix and Windows. It allows two
replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different
hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then
brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.

Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with updates
to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates that do not
conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and
displayed.

Unison allows you to either build a text only binary or a binary that will
use a graphical user interface.  To build the gtk2 graphical inteface
binary, which is the default option, do this:

  "FLAVOR=gtk2 ./unison.SlackBuild" or just "./unison.SlackBuild"

To build a textonly binary, do this:

  "FLAVOR=text ./unison.SlackBuild"

ocaml and lablgtk are build requirements, but neither are runtime deps.
