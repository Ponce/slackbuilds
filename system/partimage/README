partimage (backup system)

Partimage is opensource disk backup software. It saves partitions
having a supported filesystem on a sector basis to an image
file. Although it runs under Linux, Windows and most Linux filesystems
are supported. The image file can be compressed to save disk space and
transfer time and can be split into multiple files to be copied to CDs
or DVDs.

Partimage has a textmode user interface, plus non-interactive batch
mode operation. It supports these filesystems: ext2, ext3, reiserfs,
fat16, fat32, hpfs, jfs, xfs, ufs, hfs, ntfs. It does NOT support ext4
or btrfs. Users needing a tool like this for ext4 or btrfs are advised
to try fsarchiver.

The daemon (partimaged) is included, but the SlackBuild author hasn't
tested it. Read /usr/doc/partimage-0.6.9/README.partimaged and proceed
at your own risk. One thing not mentioned there is that partimaged
requires a dedicated user account called partimag.
