lz4 (compression algorithm)

LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at
400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It also features an extremely fast
decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high
compression derivative, called LZ4_HC, is also provided. It trades CPU
time for compression ratio.

This build includes liblz4 and the command-line lz4 tools.
