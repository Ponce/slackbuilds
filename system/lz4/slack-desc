# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lz4: lz4 (compression algorithm)
lz4:
lz4: LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
lz4: speed at 400 MB/s per core (0.16 Bytes/cycle). It also features
lz4: an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core
lz4: (0.71 Bytes/cycle). A high compression derivative, called LZ4_HC,
lz4: is also provided. It trades CPU time for compression ratio.
