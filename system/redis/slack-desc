# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

redis: Redis (Key-Value Store)
redis:
redis: Redis is an advanced key-value store.  It is similar to memcached but
redis: the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like
redis: in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.  These data
redis: types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements,
redis: add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
redis: Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or a fixed-length array.
redis: Redis supports different kinds of sorting abilities.
