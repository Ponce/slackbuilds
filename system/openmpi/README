The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and
industry partners.


Optional dependency:
PMI=yes|no (default: no), requires slurm

Note: openmpi conflicts with mpich . If you install both on the same
system, unexpected results may occur.
