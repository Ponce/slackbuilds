evtest (utility to monitor Linux input device events)

evtest is a tool to print evdev kernel events. It reads directly from
the kernel device and prints a device description and the events with
the value and the symbolic name. It can be used to determine mice
button bindings, keymaps for exotic keyboards. It is commonly used to
debug issues with input devices in X.Org.

Note: If your user is a member of the 'input' group, you should be
able to use evtest without root privilege. Otherwise, use "su" or
"sudo" to run it as root.

Note: On the one of the SlackBuild author's systems, running evtest
enables Numlock. Not a real problem, but it was surprising the first
time it happened.
