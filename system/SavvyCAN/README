SavvyCAN (Qt based cross platform canbus tool)

A Qt5 based cross platform tool which can be used to load, save, and
capture canbus frames. This tool is designed to help with visualization,
reverse engineering, debugging, and capturing of canbus frames.

Really requires at a resolution of at least 1024x768. Fully multi-monitor
capable. Works on 4K monitors as well.

You are highly recommended to use the CANDue board from EVTV.

The CANDue board must be running the GVRET firmware which can also be
found within the collin80 repos.

It is now possible to use any QT SerialBus driver (socketcan, Vector,
PeakCAN, TinyCAN). There may, however, be some loss of some functionality
as some functions of SavvyCAN are designed for use directly with the EVTVDue
and CANDue 2.0 boards.

It should, however, be noted that use of a capture device is not required to
make use of this program. It can load and save in several formats:

BusMaster log file
Microchip log file
CRTD format (OVMS log file format from Mark Webb-Johnson)
GVRET native format
Generic CSV file (ID,D0 D1 D2 D3 D4 D5 D6 D7)
Vector Trace files
IXXAT Minilog files
CAN-DO Logs
Vehicle Spy log files
CANDump / Kayak (Read only)
PCAN Viewer (Read Only)
