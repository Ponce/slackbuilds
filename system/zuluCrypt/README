zuluCrypt (CLI and GUI frontend to cryptsetup).

zuluCrypt is a simple, feature rich and powerful solution for hard drives encryption.

zuluCrypt is made up of two components: 
The back end, CLI interface is called "zuluCrypt-cli".
The front end is Qt GUI application called "zuluCrypt-gui.

* zuluCrypt:

zuluCrypt does hard drives encryption and it can manage plain dm-crypt volumes,LUKS encrypted volumes,
 TrueCrypt encrypted volumes and VeraCrypt encrypted volumes.

zuluCrypt can manage encrypted volumes that are hosted in image files,in lvm volumes,in mdraid volumes as well as in hard drives and usb sticks.

zuluCrypt can also encrypt stand alone files(zuluCrypt menu->zC->encrypt a file).

* zuluMount:

zuluMount is bundled with zuluCrypt and its meant to be used as a general purpose tool
that mount and unmount zuluCrypt supported encrypted volumes as well as unencrypted volumes
and it can be used as a substitute to udisks,pmount and related tools.

zuluMount-gui can also be used as a frontend to encfs.

zuluMount-gui is ideal for use as a desktop environment/file manager independent tool for
mounting/unmounting encrypted and unencrypted volumes.
