MJPG-streamer is a very lightweight and resource friendly video
streamer. It also comes with uvc_stream, which is a very basic
streamer, and uvc_viewer, a simple gtk viewing application.

MJPG-streamer takes JPGs from Linux-UVC compatible webcams,          
filesystem or other input plugins and streams them as M-JPEG via HTTP
to webbrowsers, VLC and other software. It is the successor of       
uvc-streamer, a Linux-UVC streaming application with Pan/Tilt

Note:

The included uvc_viewer is a 32bit binary and therefore will not
work on other archs. You may use mplayer to watch the stream
using a similar command to:

mplayer -fps 30 -demuxer lavf -cache 256 \
"http://192.168.1.2:8080/?action=stream&ignored.mjpg"

You may find that mplayer is lighter on resources anyway. Also
the viewer leaves a properties.ini file in the CWD.

There is an included start.sh script which contains many
examples for using the mjpg_streamer application. (The www directory
mentioned should be replaced by /var/mjpg-www.)

You can find it and more in /usr/doc/mjpg-streamer-$version
