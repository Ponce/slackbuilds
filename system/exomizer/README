exomizer (compression for low-resource systems)

Exomizer is a program that compresses files in a way that tries to be
as efficient as possible but still allows them to be decompressed in
environments where CPU speed and RAM are limited. For some popular 8-bit
computers using 6502 compatible CPUs it can also generate executable
files that decompress themselves in memory when run.
