gohu-font (monospace bitmap font for X)

Gohufont is a monospace bitmap font well suited for programming
and terminal use. It is intended to be very legible and offers very
discernable glyphs for all characters, including signs and symbols.

After installing, run "xset fp rehash" to get old-style X apps (such as
xterm) to see the fonts. Then try e.g. "xterm -fn gohu14".

Optional dependency: bdf2psf.

To include console fonts for framebuffer use, install misc/bdf2psf
before running this SlackBuild script. The console fonts will be
installed as /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/gohufont-*, and can be
displayed via the setfont command. To use as system default, edit
/etc/rc.d/rc.font and change the setfont line there. Don't forget to
make rc.font executable.
