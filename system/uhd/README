The USRP Hardware Driver software (UHD) is the hardware driver for all
USRP devices. It works on all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and Mac)
and can be built with GCC, Clang, and MSVC compilers. The goal of the
UHD software is to provide a host driver and API for current and future
Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use UHD software
standalone or with third-party applications.
