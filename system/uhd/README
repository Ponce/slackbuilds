The USRP Hardware Driver software (UHD) is the hardware driver for
all USRP devices. It works on all major platforms (Linux, Windows, and
Mac) and can be built with GCC, Clang, and MSVC compilers. The goal of
the UHD software is to provide a host driver and API for current and
future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use UHD software
standalone or with third-party applications.

Optional dependency: numpy3. This is required for building the UHD
Python API.
