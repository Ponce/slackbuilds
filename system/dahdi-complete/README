dahdi-complete provides everything necessary for using DAHDI (Digium/Asterisk 
Hardware Device Interface) telephony hardware with Linux. This includes:

* drivers
* configuration tools
* example configuration files
* firmware

As this package contains kernel modules that will be built for your current
kernel, you will need to rebuild (not simply reinstall) this SlackBuild if you
change/upgrade your kernel.
