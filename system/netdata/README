netdata is a system for distributed real-time performance and health
monitoring. It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of
everything happening on the system it runs, using modern interactive
web dashboards.

Optional dependencies:
- nodejs (monitoring named and SNMP devices)
- psycopg2 (monitoring postgres databases)
- MySQL-python (monitoring MySQL databases)

netdata daemon will run under netdata user and group.
You need to create the following user/group before building:
groupadd -g 338 netdata
useradd -u 338 -g 338 -c "netdata user" -s /bin/bash netdata

If you want to run this daemon on every boot:
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.netdata

Add this line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.netdata ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.netdata start
fi
