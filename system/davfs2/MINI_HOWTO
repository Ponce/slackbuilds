HOW TO CONNECT WITH A WEBDAV SERVER WITH THE DAVF2 APPLICATION

In this HOWTO, the user is named "user"
Amend as required for your choice of username.

1. Login as root

2. Define a davfs2 group and user:

	# groupadd -g 230 davfs2
	# useradd -u 230 -d /var/cache/davfs2 -g davfs2 -s /bin/false davfs2

3. Build and install davfs2 as usual.

4. Add the user if not already defined. My user shall be called chris, so:

	# adduser chris
   
   Read the Slackbook for more details on adduser, choose default settings BUT:
   with the default group list add also davfs2:

	Press ENTER to continue without adding any additional groups
	Or press the UP arrow to add/select/edit additional groups
        :  audio cdrom floppy plugdev video power netdev lp scanner davfs2

   If the user was already defined, then add davfs2 to the groups:
	
	# usermod -aG davfs2 chris

5. Edit /etc/fstab with the following line:
	WEBDAV_SERVER_URL		mount_point		davfs	noauto,user	0	0
	
	For example:
	https://example.org/chris	/home/chris/mnt/dav   	davfs   noauto,user	0	0

6. logout

7. Login again as your davfs user ("chris" in my case).

8. 	$ mkdir -p $HOME/.davfs2/certs/private/ $HOME/mnt/dav

9. Move the certificate to $HOME/davfs2/certs/private and restrict the permission to rw-------:
        For example:

	$ mv CERTIFICATE.pfx	$HOME/.davfs2/certs/private/
	$ chmod 600 $HOME/.davfs2/certs/private/CERIFICATE.PFX

10. Optionally: Copy the system configuration file. There are a lot of
    interesting comments in these files that might be helpful.

	$ cp /usr/share/davfs2/* $HOME/.davfs2/

11. Edit $HOME/.davfs2/davfs2.conf with the following line:

	clientcert	~/.davfs2/certs/private/CERTIFICATE.PFX

   Read: 

	$ man davfs2.conf 

   for all the details and options. Tests have shown that you might need more
   than the line above, so you may want to read about other interesting
   parameters, e.g.:

        add_header	Translate F

12. Edit $HOME/.davfs2/secrets with the following 2 lines:

	/home/chris/mnt/dav		username	password
	CERTIFICATE.PFX			passphrase

    The username and password are relevant to the Webdav server, not for the
    local account.
    passphrase is the password for the PFX certificate
    You should obtain all these from the Webdav server Administrator

13. Restrict permssion for $HOME/.davfs2/secrets to rw-------:

 	$ chmod 600 $HOME/.davfs2/secrets

14. Mount the davfs service on $HOME/mnt/dav 

	$ mount https://example.org/user

    You should be able to see your WEBDAV server on $HOME/mnt/user 

15. When you would like to disconnect:

	$ umount $HOME/mnt/dav

    You should get a similar response (the pid number is random):

	/sbin/umount.davfs: waiting while mount.davfs (pid 5700) synchronizes the cache .. OK
