Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the HTTP-
protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote web server. davfs2 
provides the ability to access such resources like a typical filesystem, 
allowing for use by standard applications with no built-in support for WebDAV.

Before running this SlackBuild, define a davfs2 group and a davfs2 user. The 
davfs2 user shall have davfs2 as its initial login group, shall not have no
shell and the home directory shall be /var/cache/davfs. Examples:

# groupadd -g 230 davfs2
# useradd -u 230 -d /var/cache/davfs2 -g davfs2 -s /bin/false davfs2
