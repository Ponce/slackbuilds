# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

vwm: friendly. Character based line-art compresses very well as do the
vwm: escape sequences which handle cursor manipulation. This makes VWM
vwm: quite suitable for low-bandwidth, remote connectivity over ssh.
