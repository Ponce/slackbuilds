xtrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Unix and the X 
Window system. It includes lower case, the real time clock, hi-res graphics, 
serial port, parallel printer, mouse, cassette, sound and music output 
(requires OSS), 5" and 8" floppy disk drives in single and double density, 
and even hard disk drives.

To run xtrs, you will need a 'romfile' with the contents of the original ROM 
of the model you want to emulate.  Since these are copyrighted, they are not 
included in this package.  However, do not dispair!  The xtrs page explains
how to obtain a legal copy of the MODELA/III file that can be used.  These 
or other ROM images should be copied to the /usr/share/xtrs directory.

A simple xtrs.desktop file is included that will start xtrs with
the default options.  Read the included 'xtrs' man-page after installation 
for more information and command-line options.
