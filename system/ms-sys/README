This program is used to create Microsoft compatible boot records.
It is able to do the same as Microsoft "fdisk /mbr" to a hard disk.
It is also able to do the same as Microsoft "sys d:" to a floppy or
FAT partition except that it does not copy any system files,
only the boot record is written.

It is useful when using Linux to restore a backup of a reference
Microsoft Windows installation.
(Excellent for creating bootable Windows 7 install USB).
