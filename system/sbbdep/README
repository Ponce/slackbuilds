sbbdep (Slack Build Binary Dependencies)
The tool for exploring binary runtime dependencies
on Slackware and Slackware based systems.

sbbdep uses sqlite3 for storing information.
Per default, sbbdep builds with an own version of sqlite and links statically
against it. This can be changed.
If this is done, sbbdep will need the sqlite3 package, which comes per default
with Slackware, and will link against the shared sqlite3.so library from the
system.
If you want to activate this, pass the following option to the Slackbuild.
USE_INTERNAL_SQLITE3=0
