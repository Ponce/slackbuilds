# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

srm: srm (Secure file deletion for posix systems)
srm:
srm: srm is a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm, it
srm: overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This
srm: prevents command-line recovery of the data by examining the raw block
srm: device. It may also help frustrate a physical examination of the disk,
srm: although it's unlikely that it can completely protect against this
srm: type of recovery. Please note that srm will NOT work as expected with
srm: journaled filesystem (e.g. reiserfs, ext3).
