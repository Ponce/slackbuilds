SmartCard utilities/libraries for PKCS#11/15 compatible cards

This package provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations,
and facilitate their use in security applications such as mail encryption,
authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11
API so applications supporting this API such as Mozilla Firefox and
Thunderbird can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims
to be compatible with every software that does so, too.

You may need to edit /etc/opensc.conf in order to use a particular backend
and smartcard.

Beware! Smartcards have usually a limited number of times you may try a
wrong PIN/PUK combination before they become inoperable/permanently
blocked. You have been warned!

This requires either pcsc-lite or openct (see below for details).

Since version 0.12.0, only one reader subsystem can be used and compiled
in at the same time.  The PCSC-LITE subsystem is used by default and it is
suitable for most smartcards (it requires pcsc-lite).  If you need the
OPENCT subsystem instead, you have to pass "OPENCT=1" to the script when
building and have openct installed.
