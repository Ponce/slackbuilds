# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

makeself: makeself (Make self-extractable archives on Unix)
makeself:
makeself: makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable
makeself: tgz archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell
makeself: script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is.
makeself: The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and
makeself: an optionalarbitrary command will be executed (for example an
makeself: installation script).This is pretty similar to archives generated
makeself: with WinZip Self-Extractor inthe Windows world. Makeself archives
makeself: also include checksums for integrityself-validation (CRC and/or
makeself: MD5 checksums).
