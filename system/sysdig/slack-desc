# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

sysdig: Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state
sysdig: and activity from a running Linux instance, then save, filter and
sysdig: analyze. Sysdig is scriptable in Lua and includes a command line
sysdig: interface and a powerful interactive UI, csysdig, that runs in your
sysdig: terminal. Think of sysdig as strace + tcpdump + htop + iftop + lsof
sysdig: + awesome sauce. With state of the art container visibility on top.
