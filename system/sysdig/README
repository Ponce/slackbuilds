Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state and
activity from a running Linux instance, then save, filter and analyze. Sysdig is
scriptable in Lua and includes a command line interface and a powerful
interactive UI, csysdig, that runs in your terminal. Think of sysdig as strace +
tcpdump + htop + iftop + lsof + awesome sauce. With state of the art container
visibility on top.

To build the package for a kernel different from the running one, start the
script setting the KERNEL variable as in
KERNEL=2.6.38.8 ./sysdig.SlackBuild

Optional: luajit
