nrg2cue (convert Nero .nrg CD images to bin/cue)

Usage: nrg2cue <file.NRG> [output.ISO]

If you specify the output ISO file, it will be generated too.

If you're wondering "Where is the .bin file?", the answer is that the
generated .cue file uses the .nrg image as the "bin" file, since it
contains all the data in the image anyway.
