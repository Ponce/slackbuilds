powerkit is an lightweight desktop independent full featured power manager, originally created for Slackware for use with alternative desktop environments and window managers, like  Fluxbox, Blackbox, FVWM, WindowMaker, Openbox, Lumina and others.

Hibernation/HybridSleep requires the kernel option resume=<swap_partition/swap_file>. Backlight support requires proper udev rules, see /usr/doc/powerkit-VERSION/90-backlight.rules. Read 'man powerkit' and /usr/doc/powerkit-VERSION/README.md for more information.
