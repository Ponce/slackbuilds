cups-bjnp (CUPS backend using the BJNP protocol)

This is a CUPS back-end for the Canon printers using the proprietary
USB over IP BJNP protocol. This back-end allows CUPS to print over
the network to a Canon printer. It currently supports CUPs 1.2 and
later. It is designed using reverse engineering of the protocol.
