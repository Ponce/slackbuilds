# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lbrate: lbrate (extract CP/M LBR archives)
lbrate:
lbrate: lbrate extracts/decompresses files from CP/M LBR format. (It can also
lbrate: list and test such archives.) It does this in an 'unzip'-like manner,
lbrate: mostly hiding the details of individually compressed and renamed
lbrate: files, and transparently deals with required decompression/renaming.
lbrate: lbrate supports all three CP/M compression schemes (Q, Z, Y) and
lbrate: treats them as single entry LBR archives.
