The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of a user's environment via modulefiles.

Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application.
Once the Modules package is initialized, the environment can be modified on a per-module basis
using the module command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct the module command to
alter or set shell environment variables such as PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users
on a system and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.
Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications. Modules can also be bundled into
metamodules that will load an entire suite of different applications.
