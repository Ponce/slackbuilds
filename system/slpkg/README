Slpkg is a powerful software package manager that installs, updates 
and removes packages on Slackware based systems. It automatically 
computes dependencies and figures out what things should occur 
to install packages. Slpkg makes it easier to maintain groups 
of machines without having to manually update.

Optional dependencies: python2-pythondialog, pygraphviz, graph-easy
