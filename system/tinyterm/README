tinyterm (simple terminal)

tinyterm is a simple X terminal emulator written in C.

It supports copy & paste with Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V.

Most of tinyterm's configuration is compiled in, rather than being
read from config files or command-line options. To customize tinyterm,
copy config.h from the tinyterm source to the SlackBuild's directory
and edit as you see fit. Probably the most important change for most
people will be to increase the font size (TINYTERM_FONT).
