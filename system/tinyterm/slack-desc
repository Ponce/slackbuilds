# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the firtinyterm '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the latinyterm column you can put a character in.
# You mutinyterm make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# cutinytermomary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.
