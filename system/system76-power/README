system76-power is a utility for managing graphics and power profiles.

When run in daemon mode, system76-power manages the fan speed of fans
connected to the System76 Io board on Thelio desktops.

To start the daemon at boot, add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
script and make sure rc.system76-power has executable permissions set:
  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power start
  fi

The system76-power daemon log messages are logged to
/var/log/system76-power.log by default.  Logging can be disabled by setting
LOG_FILE=/dev/null in /etc/rc.d/rc.system76-power.
