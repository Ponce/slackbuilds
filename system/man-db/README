man-db (database-driven manual pager suite)

This package provides the man command and related utilities
for examining on-line help files (manual pages). It can act as a
replacement for Slackware's man package. It has several enhancements
over man, including an indexed database for searches with -k or
apropos, the ability to easily view man pages in a browser, better
i18n support, and a much more efficient implementation of the -K (full
text search) option.

This build includes a complete install of libpipeline.

By default, man-db doesn't conflict with Slackware's man package. See
README.Slackware for details.
