resource-agents (cluster service executables)

Combined repository of OCF agents from the RHCS and Linux-HA projects

You might also want to install cluster-glue, heartbeat, resource-agents,
fence-agents.

Define OCF_ROOT and eventually OCF_RESKEY_<param> if you need to test the
resource executables manually.
