brlaser is a CUPS driver for Brother laser printers.

Although most Brother printers support a standard printer language such
as PCL or PostScript, not all do. If you have a monochrome Brother
laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open source
drivers don't work, this one might help.

Works with the Following printers:
