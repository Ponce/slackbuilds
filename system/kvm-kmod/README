KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions
(Intel VT or AMD-V).  KVM is divided into the KVM-KMOD package
(kernel modules) and the QEMU-KVM package (slightly modified QEMU)
which are both available as separate Slackbuilds.

KVM-KMOD consists of a kernel module, 'kvm.ko', that provides the
core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module,
'kvm-intel.ko' or 'kvm-amd.ko'.  Slackware provides these modules
in the 'a/kernel-modules*' packages.  In most cases, the provided 
versions are sufficient to run QEMU-KVM.  KVM-KMOD is only needed 
if you want to change the KVM modules to a different version.

KVM-KMOD updates the modules without overwriting the ones provided
by Slackware.  If you uninstall KVM-KMOD, you will need to run 
'depmod -a' to regenerate the modules.dep and map files to regain 
access to the Slackware provided versions.

You need to have a "kvm" group on the system in order to use this.
