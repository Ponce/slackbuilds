FreeSWITCH is a scalable open source cross-platform telephony platform
designed to route and interconnect popular communication protocols using
audio, video, text or any other form of media.  It was created in 2006 to
fill the void left by proprietary commercial solutions. FreeSWITCH also
provides a stable telephony platform on which many telephony applications
can be developed using a wide range of free tools.

Unlike other SlackBuilds which have a /usr installation prefix, this
script will install FreeSWITCH to /opt/freeswitch instatead. This is done
to simplify the build process since FreeSWITCH attemps to install itself
into many non-standard directories in the prefix directory. Therefore,
it is installed as a self-contained and easily-removable location in /opt.

This script also expects there to be a user and group called "freeswitch",
with uid and gid of 269 (see http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt):
# groupadd -g 269 freeswitch
# useradd -u 269 -d /opt/freeswitch -s /bin/bash -g freeswitch freeswitch

If you execute the script without creating this user and group, it won't
build the FreeSWITCH package.

To enable building with PostgreSQL support, use:
# PGSQL=yes ./freeswitch.SlackBuild

To disable building with Python support, use:
# PYTHON=no ./freeswitch.SlackBuild

erlang-otp is another optional dependency (but this is autodetected).
