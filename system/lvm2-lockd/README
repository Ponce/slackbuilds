Logical Volume Management (LVM) commands use lvmlockd to coordinate
access to shared storage.

NOTE: lvm2 package that comes with Slackware includes lvmlockd
support. However, since neither sanlock or dlm were present at build
time, empty functions were compiled in. In order for lvm commands
(such as lvmcreate, etc) to discover and leverage lvmlockd support,
stock lvm binary has to be replaced:

  CLOBBER_STOCK_BINARY=yes ./lvm2-lockd.SlackBuild

The original binary can be restored by reinstalling the stock lvm2
package.

By default, lock type is set to sanlock, dlm can be selected with:

  LOCK_TYPE=dlm ./lvm2-lockd.SlackBuild

This will change package dependency from sanlock to dlm (also found
here on SlackBuilds.org).

More information post-install can be found in README.SLACKWARE
