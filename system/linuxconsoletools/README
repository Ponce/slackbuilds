linuxconsoletools (test and config utilities for the input subsystem)

The Linux Console Project evolves from the command-line tools (jscal,
jstest, and jsattach) which were included in Version 1 of the Linux
Joystick Driver.

The original set of tools has been expanded and now includes utilities
to test and configure joysticks, connect legacy devices to the kernel's
input subsystem (providing support for serial mice, touchscreens etc.),
and test the input event layer.

Notes:

- This replaces the "joystick" build that was previously available.

- Included in this build is a simple udev rule to automatically restore
  the joystick configuration(s); see the package README in the
  documentation directory for more specific rules.

- By default, this build includes a new version of /usr/bin/inputattach,
  which overwrites the one from Slackware's gpm package. The new
  inputattach should behave identically to the old one, except
  that it supports many more devices, and is capable of running
  as a daemon. It also has a man page, which the old one didn't
  have. If you have problems with the new inputattach, reinstall
  gpm and then rebuild this package with GPM_COMPAT=yes set in the
  environment. With this option, the new inputattach will be installed
  as /usr/bin/inputattach-lct.
