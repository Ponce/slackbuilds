linuxconsoletools (test and config utilities for the input subsystem)

The Linux Console Project evolves from the command-line tools (jscal,
jstest, and jsattach) which were included in Version 1 of the Linux
Joystick Driver.

The original set of tools has been expanded and now includes utilities
to test and configure joysticks, connect legacy devices to the kernel's
input subsystem (providing support for serial mice, touchscreens etc.),
and test the input event layer.

Notes:

- This replaces the "joystick" build that was previously available.

- Included in this build is a simple udev rule to automatically restore the
  joystick configuration(s); see the package README in the documentation
  directory for more specific rules.

- By default, this build includes a newer version of /usr/bin/inputattach,
  which overwrites the one from Slackware's gpm package. The new
  inputattach should behave identically to the old one, except that it
  supports many more devices, and is capable of running as a daemon. It
  also has a man page, which the old one didn't have. If you have problems
  with the new inputattach, reinstall gpm and then rebuild this package
  with GPM_COMPAT=yes set in the environment. With this option, the new
  inputattach will be installed as /usr/bin/inputattach-lct.
