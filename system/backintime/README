Back In Time is a simple backup tool for Linux inspired from "flyback
project" and "TimeVault". The backup is done by taking snapshots of a
specified set of directories.

All you have to do is configure:

    * Where to save snapshot
    * What directories to backup
    * When backup should be done (manual, every hour, every day,
    every week, every month)

Launch the GUI with backintime-kde4 or from the system menu.
