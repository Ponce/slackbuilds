isomd5sum provides a way of making use of the ISO9660 application data
area to store md5sum data about the iso.  This allows you to check the
iso given nothing more than the iso itself.

A checksum is implanted in an image using the implantisomd5 utility,
and the corresponding checkisomd5 utility can be used to verify burned
CDs are error-free. Also included is a Python extension for performing
these tasks.
