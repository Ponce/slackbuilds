unac (remove accents from text)

unac is a C library (libunac) and command (unaccent) that removes
accents from a string of text; it replaces accented characters in the
given character set with their unaccented (ASCII) equivalents.

See also: perl/perl-text-unaccent, for a Perl module based on this.
