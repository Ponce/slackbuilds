sdl-jstest (SDL joystick test utility)

sdl-jstest is a simple program that lets you find out how many
joysticks SDL detected on your system, how many axes, buttons, hats
and balls they have each. It also lets you test the joysticks by
displaying the events they send or by displaying their current button,
axis, hat or ball state. sdl-jstest is especially useful if you want
to test your SDL Linux joystick configuration.

Optional dependency: if SDL2 is installed, the SDL2 version will
be built and installed as sdl2-jstest.
