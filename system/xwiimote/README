xwiimote is a library and a userspace tool for testing Wiimote
functionality when connected with kernel's hid-wiimote device driver
(which also is part of the project and was included in the kernel
sources since version 3.1)

It differs from cwiid in that it uses existing kernel drivers to
interface with the device and does not need userspace daemons to
work.
