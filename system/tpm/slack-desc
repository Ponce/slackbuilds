# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

tpm: tpm (Tiny password manager)
tpm:
tpm: tpm is a tiny shell script which is heavily inspired and largely
tpm: compatible with pass. Just like pass it uses gpg2 to securely store
tpm: your passwords, the major difference between pass and tpm is that the
tpm: latter is a lot more minimal. Furthermore, tpm is written entirely in
tpm: POSIX shell.
