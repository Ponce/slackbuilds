tpm is a tiny shell script which is heavily inspired and largely compatible with pass.
Just like pass it uses gpg2 to securely store your passwords, the major difference
between pass and tpm is that the latter is a lot more minimal. Furthermore, tpm is
written entirely in POSIX shell.

Invoking tpm consists of specifying a command either insert or show and supplying one
entry as a target. If insert is specified as a command tpm will create a new entry and
prompt for the corresponding password. If you specify show as a command tpm will write
the password for the given entry to standard output.
