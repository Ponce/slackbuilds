ZoneMinder is a Linux video camera security and surveillance solution.

This suite is intended for use in single or multi-camera video
security applications, commercial or home CCTV. It supports capture,
analysis, recording, and monitoring of video data. PTZ cameras can
be controlled via web or semi-automatically using a variety of
protocols. It can also be integrated into a home automation system
via X.10 or other protocols.  This build includes cambozola and jscalendar.

Optional dependencies are ffmpeg (video streaming and recoding support),
perl-Archive-Zip (automatic event uploading), perl-X10 
(integration with X10-based home automation), perl-Device-SerialPort 
(RS232/RS485 PTZ camera control), perl-MIME-Lite, and perl-MIME-Entity 
(automatic event mail notification).

See README.SLACKWARE for configuration information.
