Bacula (Manage backup, recovery) - Client and server

Bacula is a set of Open Source, computer programs that permit you (or the
system administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer
data across a network of computers of different kinds. Bacula is relatively
easy to use and very efficient, while offering many advanced storage management
features that make it easy to find and recover lost or damaged files. In
technical terms, it is an Open Source, network based backup program.

This script has a few build options:

  DATABASE=auto|mysql|postgresql|sqlite - by default MySQL/MariaDB is selected
  OPT_PREFIX=yes|no - install into /opt/bacula (disabled by default)
  BAT=yes|no - build with GUI support (disabled by default)
  EMAIL=root@localhost - destination for job announcements and core dumps
  SMTPHOST=localhost - expects smtp daemon running on localhost
