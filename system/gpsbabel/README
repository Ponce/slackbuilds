GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to another,
whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme, Streets and
Trips, or even a serial or USB upload or download to a GPS receiver such as
those from Garmin and Magellan.  By flattening the Tower of Babel that the
authors of various programs for manipulating GPS data have imposed upon us, it
returns to us the ability to freely move our own waypoint data between the
programs and hardware we choose to use.

It contains extensive data manipulation abilities making it a convenient for
server-side processing or as the backend for other tools.

It does not convert, transfer, send, or manipulate maps. We process data that
may (or may not be) placed on a map, such as waypoints, tracks, and routes.
