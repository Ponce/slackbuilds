man-pages-ja (Japanese language man pages)

Notes:

- Script author doesn't speak or read Japanese. If there are problems with
  the contents of the man pages themselves, contact the upstream author or
  join the linuxjm-discuss@lists.sourceforge.jp mailing list.

- Upstream appears to update the source on the 15th of every month. I won't
  have time to update this SlackBuild every month, but most likely you can
  use the updated versions like so:

  # VERSION=20160115 ./man-pages-ja.SlackBuild

  If this doesn't work, let me know and I'll update the build script.

- Don't forget to source /etc/profile.d/man-db.sh or log out and back
  in after installing man-db. Slackware's standard man can't handle these.

- I tested with LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 in the environment. You can set this
  system-wide in /etc/profile.d/lang.sh, or per-user in e.g. .bash_profile.

- In X, use a unicode-capable terminal (urxvt, xcfe4-terminal, or even
  xterm with appropriate .Xdefaults) with a font that has glyphs for
  Japanese, such as "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

- I suspect it would also work to use LANG=ja_JP.eucjp if a eucjp terminal
  is used, but don't know how to test this.

- I have no idea how (or if) it's possible to use a Japanese font in the
  Linux console. If anyone has any information, contact me at the email
  address in the .info file and I'll add it to this README.
