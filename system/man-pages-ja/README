man-pages-ja (Japanese language man pages)

Notes:

- Script author doesn't speak or read Japanese. If there are problems
  with the contents of the man pages themselves, contact the upstream
  author or join the linuxjm-discuss@lists.sourceforge.jp mailing
  list.

- Upstream appears to update the source on the 15th of every month. I
  won't have time to update this SlackBuild every month, but most
  likely you can use the updated versions like so:

  # VERSION=20160115 ./man-pages-ja.SlackBuild

  If this doesn't work, let me know and I'll update the build script.

- I tested with LANG=ja_JP.UTF-8 in the environment. You can
  set this system-wide in /etc/profile.d/lang.sh, or per-user in
  e.g. .bash_profile.

- In X, use a unicode-capable terminal (urxvt, xcfe4-terminal, or even
  xterm with appropriate .Xdefaults) with a font that has glyphs for
  Japanese, such as "WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono".

- I suspect it would also work to use LANG=ja_JP.eucjp if a eucjp
  terminal is used, but don't know how to test this.

- I have no idea how (or if) it's possible to use a Japanese font in
  the Linux console. If anyone has any information, contact me at the
  email address in the .info file and I'll add it to this README.
