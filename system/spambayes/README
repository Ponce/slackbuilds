SpamBayes uses a different set of algorithm to most statistical spam filters,
which enables to dramatically lower the number of legitimate mail classified as
spam, through the introduction of an 'unsure' category.

SpamBayes can be used as a POP3 or an IMAP proxy, as well as a simple mail
filter for use with procmail.
