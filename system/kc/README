kc is a console based password storing application using an encrypted XML 
document as its database.

Features include (but not limited to):
 * fixed string or regex based search (if compiled with pcre)
 * encrypted or plain text database import/export
 * fuzzy displaying of passwords if you suspect someone might watch
   your monitor
 * copy passwords to various clipboards
 * multiple keychains per database
 * the usual editing functions
 * compiles and works on *BSD and Linux
 * editline (libedit) and readline support
 * clean and simple CLI with command and keychain completion

This SlackBuild has build options to control some of its behavior:
LIBSCRYPT:	If this variable is set, kc will be built with scrypt
		encrypted passwords support. It needs the libscrypt library
		for this, that is also available from SBo.
EDITLINE:	If this variable is set, kc will use editline for its
		command line interface. Otherwise readline will be used.
		It needs the libedit library for this, that is also available
		from SBo.
