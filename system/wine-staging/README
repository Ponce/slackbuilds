Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.

This is Wine patched on the fly with the staging patches, which bring
experimental but useful new Wine features such as PhysX support, EAX, and
more.

NOTE: At the moment, it only compiles a 32-bit version of Wine, this may
change in the future with the ability to compile both 64-bit and 32-bit
version of Wine. You'll need a multilib system in order to compile this.

While this is list as a separate package, this WILL overwrite your normal
Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

Compile options/Optional dependences (keep in mind, you need 32-bit libs of
each):
