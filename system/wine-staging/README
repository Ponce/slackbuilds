wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)

It contains bug fixes and features, which have not been integrated
into the development branch yet. The idea of Wine Staging is to
provide experimental features faster to end users and to give
developers the possibility to discuss and improve their patches before
they are integrated into the main branch.

Wine Staging is maintained as a set of patches which has to be applied
on top of the corresponding Wine development version. Package
maintainers can decide if they want to include our full patchset, or
only want to cherry-pick patches for specific bugs

NOTE: At the moment, it only compiles a 32-bit version of Wine, this may
change in the future with the ability to compile both 64-bit and 32-bit
version of Wine. You'll need a multilib system in order to compile this.

While this is list as a separate package, this WILL overwrite your normal
Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

Compile options/Optional dependences (keep in mind, you need 32-bit libs
of each):
