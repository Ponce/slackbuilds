wine-staging (Wine Staging is the testing area of winehq.org)

It contains bug fixes and features, which have not been integrated
into the development branch yet. The idea of Wine Staging is to
provide experimental features faster to end users and to give
developers the possibility to discuss and improve their patches
before they are integrated into the main branch.

This is a current development branch of Wine appended with full
patches of the Staging branch.

NOTE: At the moment, it only compiles a 32-bit version of Wine,
this may change in the future with the ability to compile both
64-bit and 32-bit versions of Wine. You'll need a full multilib
system in order to compile this under x86_64 system.

While this is list as a separate package, this WILL overwrite
your normal Wine binaries! Please keep this in mind.

Compile options/optional dependences (keep in mind, you need
32-bit libs of each):

See README.SLACKWARE for a giant list of dependencies.
