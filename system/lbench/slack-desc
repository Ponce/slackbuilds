# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lbench: Lbench was written to satisfy a personal desire to better understand
lbench: some obscure performance issues. The performance increase from using
lbench: multiple processor cores can be nearly 100% per core in some cases,
lbench: and negative (an overall slowdown) in others.
