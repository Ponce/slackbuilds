The TeX Gyre (TG) Collection of Fonts

These fonts do not support Cyrillic.

This package does _not_ touch TeXLive, if it is installed, it
installes the fonts systemwide, so that LibreOffice or fontconfig
and freetype can use them.

TeX Gyre is a package from GUST, it implements 8 standard PostScript
fonts in OTF, under different names.
