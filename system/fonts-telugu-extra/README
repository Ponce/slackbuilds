This is an collection of Extra Telugu Fonts for Slackware
Linux. Telugu is spoken in the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh
and Telangana by about 96 Milliion Peoople.

The Fonts are from

1. Silicon Andhra/Debian
2. Google Fonts
3. New Life Computer Institute
4. SIL

I've added Font for Gunjala Gondi Script here
since it is a Dravidian language and is spoken
in the state of Telangana apart from Eastern
Maharastra, South Eastern Madhya Pradesh and
Chhattishgarh.

The Homepages and download urls are in URL.md file.
The list of the fonts included are in FONTS.md file.

The fonts from Google can be installed using the
program fnt which is available in SBo.

To install Google fonts run the slackbuild as
GOOGLEFONTS=YES ./fonts-telugu-extra.SlackBuild

To install Gondi Script font run the slackbuild as
GONDI=YES ./fonts-telugu-extra.SlackBuild

NOTE:
If you install google fonts that comes with
this package it will conflict with google-fonts
package in SBo.
