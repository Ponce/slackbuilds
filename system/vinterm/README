vinterm (terminal emulator that simulates 1980s CRT appearance)

Use a terminal in style, like in the good old days! Vintage Terminal
is a terminal emulator that simulates the looks of a 1980s monitor.

Vintage Terminal has the following features:

- Full terminal capabilities implemented
- Scaling (zoom) with the argument -s
- Window resize/maximize
- Full screen (CTRL+F11) and fullscreen with 80 columns (CTRL+SHIFT+F11)
- UNICODE support (no unicode font yet)
- Terminal rollback
- Mouse support (new in 0.5.0)
- Has a authentic old look based on a IBM 5151 monitor

The package includes a vim color scheme by the vinterm author that's
meant to make vim's syntax highlighting look better in vinterm. To use
it in vim, enter ":colorscheme vinterm" (or load it from your .vimrc).
