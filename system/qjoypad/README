qjoypad takes input from a gamepad or joystick and translates it
into key strokes or mouse actions, letting you control any X-Windows
program with your game controller. It also lets you play games with 
your gamepad/joystick that otherwise don't have joystick/gamepad
support.

When launching qjoypad an icon will be placed in your system tray.  
Clicking on that icon will open the configuration GUI.
