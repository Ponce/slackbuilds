# 20210829 bkw: Install man pages in /usr/share/ru, not
# /usr/share/ru.UTF-8. man-db will look in both places. Changed this
# to make it match the other man-pages-* builds.

# 20201105 bkw: This hasn't been updated in 7+ years, and I'm not sure
# it ever worked properly with 14.2's man command. Update to latest
# version and document how to get this stuff to work with man-db and a
# utf-8 capable terminal.
