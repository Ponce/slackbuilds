OpenSnitch is a GNU/Linux interactive application firewall inspired by
Little Snitch.

Opensnitch requires the opensnitchd rc script to execute upon startup.
That is:

1. Make /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd executable:
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd

2. Add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
[ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd start

3. Add the following line to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:
[ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.opensnitchd stop

To install the eBPF process monitor module (requires kernel-source),
pass in eBPF=yes to the SlackBuild.

The eBFP module additionally requires kernel support for KProbes
(kernel probes) and syscalls tracing. README.SLACKWARE contains
instructions for compiling a kernel with these features.
