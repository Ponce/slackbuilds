collectd (statistics collection daemon)

collectd is a daemon which collects system performance statistics
periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety
of ways, for example in RRD files and backends like Graphite.

collectd gathers statistics about the system it is running on and
stores this information. Those statistics can then be used to find
current performance bottlenecks (i.e. performance analysis) and
predict future system load (i.e.  capacity planning). Or if you just
want pretty graphs of your private server and are fed up with some
homegrown solution you're at the right place, too ;).

Optional, tested, recommended dependencies:
rrdtool, yajl

Optional, not heavily tested dependencies:
libvirt, lua, postgresql

This package has several more optional dependencies, which are
autodetected, but are mostly not tested by me (feedback welcome!):

ganglia, gpsd, hiredis, i2c-tools, kafka, libdbi, libesmtp,
libmemcached, libmicrohttpd, libmodbus, libsigrok, libstatgrab,
mongo-c, mosquitto, protobuf, protobuf-c, rabbitmq-c, tokyotyrant,
varnish, xen
