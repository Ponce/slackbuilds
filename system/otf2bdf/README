otf2bdf (opentype/truetype to bdf font converter)

otf2bdf is a command line utility that uses the FreeType 2 font
rendering library to generate BDF bitmap fonts from OpenType/TrueType
outline fonts at different sizes and resolutions. This program
is essentially the same as the ttf2bdf program except that it uses
FreeType 2.*, not FreeType 1.*, has some bug fixes, and includes a new
command line parameter to print out the available encoding tables in
the font.

For best results, the original font should be monospaced.

The mapping files for use with the -m option are installed in
/usr/share/otf2bdf/.
