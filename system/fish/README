fish (Friendly Interactive SHell) is a user friendly command line shell 
for UNIX-like operating systems. 

Post installation, fish outputs the following message regarding setting up 
fish as your primary shell:
	To run fish, type 'fish' in your terminal.
To use fish as your login shell:
	* add the line '/usr/bin/fish' to the file '/etc/shells'.
	* use the command 'chsh -s /usr/bin/fish'.

To set your colors, run 'fish_config'
To scan your man pages for completions, run 'fish_update_completions'
To autocomplete command suggestions press Ctrl + F or right arrow key.

This package will potentially conflict with the /usr/games/fish binary
from the y/bsdgames package.  In a stock installation with default PATH
ordering, /usr/bin should be checked before /usr/games, so it shouldn't
be an issue, but we thought it was worth noting just in case.
