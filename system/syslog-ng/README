The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging
application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted logging
solutions. This free, open-source version is an extremely well-developed,
high performance, stable system being the Linux/Unix world's most frequently
used alternative central logging system. The application can operate in server
or agent mode, and - apart from UDP - supports the reliable TCP and the
encrypted TLS protocols. That way syslog-ng can be used to create flexible
and reliable logging infrastructure even in heterogeneous environments.

libdbi is an optional dependency (enables SQL support). GeoIP support can be
enabled with: GEOIP=yes ./syslog-ng.SlackBuild
 
For more information on how to install and run syslog-ng, see README.SLACKWARE
that came with this package (which is also installed with the docs).
