The syslog-ng application is a flexible and highly scalable system logging
application that is ideal for creating centralized and trusted logging
solutions. This free, open-source version is an extremely well-developed,
high performance, stable system being the Linux/Unix world's most frequently
used alternative central logging system. The application can operate in
server or agent mode, and - apart from UDP - supports the reliable TCP and
the encrypted TLS protocols. That way syslog-ng can be used to create
flexible and reliable logging infrastructure even in heterogeneous
environments.

This requires eventlog.  For SQL support, you also need libdbi.

For more information on how to install and run syslog-ng, see README.SLACKWARE
that came with this package (which is also installed with the docs).
