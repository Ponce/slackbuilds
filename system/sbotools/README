sbotools (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sbotools is a set of perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to slackbuilds.org. Its features include requirement handling
and the ability to handle 32-bit and compat32 builds on multilib
x86_64 systems.

There are man pages for each of the sbo* commands, and more documentation,
as well as online versions of the man pages, can be found at
http://pink-mist.github.io/sbotools/documentation/

sbotools bundles the required Perl module Sort::Versions with it. This does
not interfere with a copy installed from the CPAN, or from slackbuilds.org.

sbotools is written and maintained by d4wnr4z0r, xocel, and pink_mist;
we can be contacted in #sbotools on freenode.
