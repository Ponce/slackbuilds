sbotools (ports-like interface to slackbuilds.org)

sbotools is a set of perl scripts providing a ports-like automation
interface to slackbuilds.org. Its features include requirement handling
and the ability to handle 32-bit and compat32 builds on multilib
x86_64 systems.

There are man pages for each of the sbo* commands, and more documentation,
