pcsc-tools provides some utilities that allow you to mess with your smart
card reader, or to test a PC/SC driver.

ATR_analysis - analyze a smart card "Answer to Reset" message
pcsc_scan - query the status of a smart card reader using pcsc-lite
scriptor - send commands to a smart card using a batch file or stdin
gscriptor - GTK frontend to scriptor

pcsc_scan requires pcsc-lite to build and run.

The rest of the above require pcsc-perl as a runtime dependency only,
and gscriptor needs perl-gtk2 as a runtime-only dependency.
