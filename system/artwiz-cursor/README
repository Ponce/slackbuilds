Artwiz fonts are small futuristic ASCII and mouse cursor fonts for X.
This package only contains the artwiz mouse cursor font.

This package is intended to replace x/font-cursor-misc from Slackware.
Uninstall the font-cursor-misc package just before installing this one.
Alternatively, read the comments in the SlackBuild script for instructions on
how to choose between the two when both are installed.

After installation you will need to restart X for the changes to take effect.

After uninstallation you will need to reinstall the font-cursor-misc package
so that X can find the appropriate cursor font the next time it starts.
