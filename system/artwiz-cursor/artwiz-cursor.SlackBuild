# The x/font-cursor-misc package already contains a file named "cursor.pcf.gz".
# Rename the file in this package to "artwiz-cursor.pcf.gz" so we don't clobber
# the original.  This also lets us have both packages installed simultaneously.

# It is possible to have both this package and x/font-cursor-misc installed at
# the same time.  When mkfontdir runs, it will find that both files contain a
# font named "cursor", then will choose one (I don't know what criteria it
# uses) and will add an entry for it to the fonts.dir file.  X will find the
# entry and use the corresponding cursor font file.
#
# To switch between cursor fonts, edit /usr/share/fonts/misc/fonts.dir and
# change the line
#   cursor.pcf.gz cursor
# to
#   artwiz-cursor.pcf.gz cursor
# then restart X.
#
# You may have to repeat this step every time you run mkfontdir in
# /usr/share/fonts/misc (such as after you add other fonts).
