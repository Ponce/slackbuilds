Zopfli Compression Algorithm is a compression library programmed in C to perform
very good, but slow, deflate or zlib compression.

The basic function to compress data is ZopfliCompress in zopfli.h. Use the
ZopfliOptions object to set parameters that affect the speed and compression.
Use the ZopfliInitOptions function to place the default values in the
ZopfliOptions first.

ZopfliCompress supports deflate, gzip and zlib output format with a parameter.
To support only one individual format, you can instead use ZopfliDeflate in
deflate.h, ZopfliZlibCompress in zlib_container.h or ZopfliGzipCompress in
gzip_container.h.

This library can only compress, not decompress. Existing zlib or deflate
libraries can decompress the data.

Zopfli Compression Algorithm was created by Lode Vandevenne and Jyrki
Alakuijala, based on an algorithm by Jyrki Alakuijala.
