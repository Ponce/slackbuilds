man-pages-fr (french system documentation)

French translation files for the man pages. This build includes both
"man-pages-fr" and "man-pages-extra-fr".

By default, the man pages are installed as UTF-8. This should work
with man-db regardless of whether you use a Unicode (fr_FR.UTF-8) or
ISO-8859-1/Latin-1 (fr_FR) setting for LANG.

If you set UTF8=no in the environment, the man pages will be converted
to Latin-1. This is not recommended for Slackware 15.0 and up.
