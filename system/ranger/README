A multi-column display allows viewing in a tree-like manner. You can
preview the content of the selected file or directory, copy or move
files around with the VIM-like commands dd and yy, execute predefined
applications when opening a file, etc...
Everything is fully customizable and written in Python (2.6 and 3.1
compatible) using curses for the text-based user interface.
