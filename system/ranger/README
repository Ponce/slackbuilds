A multi-column display allows viewing in a tree-like manner. You can
preview the content of the selected file or directory, copy or move
files around with the VIM-like commands dd and yy, execute predefined
applications when opening a file, etc.

Everything is fully customizable and written in Python (2.7 and 3.1
compatible) using curses for the text-based user interface.

Optional dependencies:

w3m (for inline display of images)
atool (for listing archives in preview pane)

Options:

To build for python3, use:

PYTHON3=1 ./ranger.SlackBuild
