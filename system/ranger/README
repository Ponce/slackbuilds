ranger (a curses file manager that uses vi/vim bindings)

A multi-column display allows viewing in a tree-like manner. You can preview
the content of the selected file or directory, copy or move files around with
the VIM-like commands dd and yy, execute predefined applications when opening a
file, etc.

Everything is fully customizable and written in Python (2.7 and 3.1 compatible)
using curses for the text-based user interface.

Optional Helpers:

w3m (for inline display of images)
atool (for listing files inside archives in the preview pane)
highlight or (python3-)Pygments (for coloured previews)

(Note that highlight is used by default. Pygments requires editing the
preview script 'scope.sh')

Options:

To build for python3, use:

PYTHON3=yes ./ranger.SlackBuild
