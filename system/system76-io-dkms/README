DKMS module for controlling System76 Io board.

This kernel module enables reading/controlling the fan speed of fans plugged
into the System76 Io board on Thelio desktops.

To ensure loading of the system76-io kernel module, you may need to add
modprobe system76-io
to /etc/rc.d/rc.modules.local.

See system76-power (available on SBo) for a daemon to control the fan speed.

The system76-io dkms module is automatically registered with dkms by
doinst.sh with the following command:
dkms install system76-io/$VER

A douninst.sh script is included which calls "dkms remove" to delete all
kernel versions of the old module on package removal or upgrade.
