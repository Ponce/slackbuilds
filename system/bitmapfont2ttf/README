bitmapfont2ttf (convert bitmap BDF fonts to vector TTF)

bitmapfont2ttf is a fontforge Python script which autotraces the glyphs
in a bitmap font and converts it to a vector (outline) TrueType font.
The resulting font retains its "pixelated" look when scaled up to any
size.

bitmapfont2ttf is a bit picky about the BDF fonts it will accept as
input. This build includes a patch that allows it to work with fonts
produced by psf2bdf (from psftools). The patch is applied by default,
but you can export PRISTINE=yes in the environment if you really don't
want it.

If you're trying to convert a PCF font, use pcf2bdf to turn it into a
BDF first.

If you're looking for exact-autotrace, it's included in this build.
