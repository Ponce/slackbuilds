ZFS is a modern filesystem originally developed for SOLARIS.
It provides many functionalities such as snapshots, data compression,
data recovery, filesystem (snapshot) sending/reveiving, and more.

NOTE: You'll need the kernel source code to be able to compile this.
This package is kernel dependent, so you'll need to recompile it for
every new kernel you choose to run.

Please use KERNEL environment variable if target kernel version differs
from that of the build machine, e.g. `export KERNEL=5.15.116`.

Dracut support is compiled in if dracut is installed at the time of
building.

NOTE for Slackware-x86: this build requires i686, i586 will fail.
