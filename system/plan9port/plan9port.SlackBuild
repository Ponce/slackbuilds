# All plan9 programs are going to be installed in "/opt/plan9"

# The default prefix for plan9 is "/usr/local/plan9" and some files (that are
# listed in $TMP/plan9/lib/moveplan9.files) are going to end up with that
# prefix hardcoded. There's a script that resolves this problem, and the 
# compilation runs it by default, but we'll have to edit it because it uses
# the current build directory as the path.  I've tried passing /opt/plan9
# as the value of PLAN9, hoping the script would pick it up and do the 
# right thing, but no dice, so we'll kludge it.  --rworkman
