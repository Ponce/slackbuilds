# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

cntlm: cntlm (Authentication Proxy)
cntlm:
cntlm: Cntlm is an NTLM / NTLM Session Response / NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP
cntlm: proxy intended to help you break free from the chains of Microsoft
cntlm: proprietary world. You can use a free OS and honor our noble idea,
cntlm: but you can't hide. Once you're behind those cold steel bars of a
cntlm: corporate proxy server requiring NTLM authentication, you're done
cntlm: with. The same even applies to 3rd party Windows applications, which
cntlm: don't support NTLM natively.
