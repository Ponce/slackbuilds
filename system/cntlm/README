Cntlm is an NTLM / NTLM Session Response / NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP proxy 
intended to help you break free from the chains of Microsoft proprietary world.
You can use a free OS and honor our noble idea, but you can't hide. Once you're 
behind those cold steel bars of a corporate proxy server requiring NTLM
authentication, you're done with. The same even applies to 3rd party Windows 
applications, which don't support NTLM natively.

This package contain a start/stop script: /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm

If you need start cntlm at boot add the following to your /etc/rc.d/rc.local
script and make sure rc.cntlm has executable permissions set:

  if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm ]; then
    /etc/rc.d/rc.cntlm start
  fi
