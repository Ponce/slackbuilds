lxterminal (LXDE terminal emulator)

LXTerminal is a quick configurable terminal emulator, based on vte libs.
It uses a single process for each window/tab so it's very light on
resources.

Pass the script the variable GTK3=yes if you want to link this against
gtk+3 instead of the default gtk+2 (in this case you will need the
optional dependency vte3).
