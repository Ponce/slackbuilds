opam - OCaml Package Manager

OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports
multiple simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package
constraints, and a Git-friendly development workflow.

Managing your OCaml installation can be as simple as:

  opam list -a      # List the available packages
  opam install lwt  # Install LWT
  opam update       # Update the package list
  ...
  opam upgrade      # Upgrade installed packages to their latest version


It has to be initialised. To do it, you can use the following command:

  opam init

It is not recommended to run opam as root.
Apparently it rather installs per-user packages.
