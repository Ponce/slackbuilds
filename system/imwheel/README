IMWheel is a universal mouse wheel and mouse stick translator for X Windows
using either a special version of gpm and its /dev/gpmwheel FIFO or the
support for a ZAxis on the mouse built into X.  Utilizing the input from gpm
or X Windows, imwheel translates mouse wheel and mouse stick actions into
keyboard events using the XTest extension to X.  Use xdpyinfo for information
on the supported extensions in your X server.

This build script has a patch that disables the configurator appearing when
you mouse up and down on the root window.  I did this because it stopped the
ability for workspace changing in fluxbox and other WMs, and it would also
pop up at the most annoying times ;)  However, the configurator window can
still be found with the "-c" switch.

If you do NOT wish to apply this patch, run the script with PATCH=no in the
environment:

PATCH=no ./imwheel.SlackBuild
