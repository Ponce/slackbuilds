SASH - a stand-alone shell with many built-in commands

The sash program is a stand-alone shell which is useful for recovering
from certain types of system failures.  In particular, it was created
in order to cope with the problem of missing shared libraries or important 
executables.

Sash can execute external programs, as in any shell.  There are no
restrictions on these commands, as the standard shell is used to execute 
them if there are any non-wildcard meta-characters in the command.
More importantly, however, is that many of the standard system commands
are built-in to sash.

This script applies the 'sash-plus-patches' command collection, which
adds the following commands: 'chroot' 'pivot_root' and 'losetup'.

These functions actually provide interfaces to the respective Linux system
calls. They are specificly useful when sash is used as a shell in "initial
ramdisk" (initrd) environments.

In addition, a simple shell variable expansion support has been added, e.g.
the variable "$(VAR)" is replaced by the content of the variable "VAR".
