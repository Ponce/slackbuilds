# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

postgis: PostGIS (support for geographic objects in PostgreSQL)
postgis:
postgis: PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
postgis: database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables" the PostgreSQL
postgis: server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for
postgis: geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's SDE or
postgis: Oracle's Spatial extension.
