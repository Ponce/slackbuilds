i2c-tools (utilities for I2C)

The I2C tools that used to be part of the lm-sensors package have been
split to a separate package.
The i2c-tools package contains a heterogeneous set of I2C tools for
Linux: a bus probing tool, a chip dumper, register-level SMBus access
helpers, EEPROM decoding scripts, EEPROM programming tools, and a
python module for SMBus access.
