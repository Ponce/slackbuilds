# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

lsyncd: lsyncd (live syncing daemon - syncs local dirs wth remote targets)
lsyncd:
lsyncd: Lsyncd watches a local directory trees event monitor interface 
lsyncd: (inotify).  It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and
lsyncd: then spawns one (or more) process(es) to synchronize the changes. 
lysncd: By default this is rsync.  Lsyncd is thus a lightweight live mirror 
lsyncd: solution that is comparatively easy to install not requiring new 
lsyncd: filesystems or blockdevices and does not hamper local filesystem 
lsyncd: performance.
