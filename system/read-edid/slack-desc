# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

read-edid:
read-edid: read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for
read-edid: reading the EDID from a monitor. It should work with most monitors
read-edid: made since 1996 (except for newer ones with 256-byte EDID's - WiP),
read-edid: assuming the video card supports the standard read commands (most
read-edid: do).read-edid is a set of two tools - get-edid, which gets the raw
read-edid: edid information from the monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the
read-edid: raw binary information into an XF86Config-compatible monitor section.
