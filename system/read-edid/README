read-edid (read EDID information from a video monitor)

read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading
the EDID from a monitor. It should work with most monitors made since
1996 (except for some newer ones with 256-byte EDIDs - WiP), assuming
the video card supports the standard read commands (most do).

read-edid is a set of two tools: get-edid, which gets the raw edid
information from the monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the raw
binary information into an xorg.conf-compatible Monitor section.

Modern Linux kernels also make the EDID data available in
/sys/class/drm/card*-*/edid, so the get-edid command might not be
needed.

See also system/edid-decode, which gives more detail than parse-edid,
but doesn't format its output as an xorg.conf-compatible snippet.
