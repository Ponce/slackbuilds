read-edid (read EDID information from a video monitor)

read-edid is a pair of tools (originally by John Fremlin) for reading the
EDID from a monitor. It should work with most monitors made since 1996
(except for newer ones with 256-byte EDID's - WiP), assuming the video
card supports the standard read commands (most do).read-edid is a set
of two tools - get-edid, which gets the raw edid information from the
monitor, and parse-edid, which turns the raw binary information into an
XF86Config-compatible monitor section.
