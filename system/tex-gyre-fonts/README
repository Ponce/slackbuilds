The TeX Gyre (TG) Collection of Fonts is an extensive remake and
extension of the freely available 35 base PostScript fonts
distributed with Ghostscript ver. 4.00.
The important aspect of the project is providing not only the support
for TeX but also the cross-platform OpenType format of the fonts.
