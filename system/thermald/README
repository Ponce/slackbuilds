The Linux Thermal Daemon program from Intel Open Source Technology Center

Thermald deals with thermal issues for Intel processor families
codenamed Intel Sandy-Bridge and above. It is a Linux daemon
used to prevent the overheating of systems. This daemon monitors
temperature and applies compensation using available cooling methods.

Since this is a daemon, it can be started at boot via /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
  /usr/sbin/thermald

An entry could be added to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown as well:
  killall thermald

Optional dependency: msr-tools

To upgrade please remove thermal_daemon first and then install thermald.

NOTE:
If thermald failed to launch, try adding this option first:
--ignore-cpuid-check
