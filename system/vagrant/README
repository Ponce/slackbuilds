Vagrant is a tool for building complete virtualised development environments.

Vagrant was originally written as a wrapper around VirtualBox, but it now
supports plugins for Amazon EC2, VMware and other virtualisation software.
Vagrant also integrates with provisioning software such as Chef, Puppet
and Ansible.
