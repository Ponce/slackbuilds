# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

smem: smem (memory reporting tool)
smem:
smem: smem is a tool that can give numerous reports on memory usage on
smem: Linux systems.  Unlike existing tools, smem can report proportional
smem: set size (PSS), which is a more meaningful representation of the
smem: amount of memory used by libraries and applications in a virtual
smem: memory system.
