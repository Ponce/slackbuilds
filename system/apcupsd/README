APCUPSD can be used for power management and controlling most of APC's UPS 
models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with most of APC's 
Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such as Back-UPS
and BackUPS-Office.

This buildscript veers from the "accepted" installation of apcupsd, but for 
what I believe you'll see are justifiable reasons.  The stock install of 
apcupsd detects its presence on Slackware and attempts to patch the system's
/etc/rc.d/rc.6 script and places the rc.apcupsd script inside /etc/rc.d 
(instead of DESTDIR/etc/rc.d - in essence, it touches files outside DESTDIR).
I don't view this as even remotely acceptable, so the build script disables 
the distribution-specific installation to prevent messing with files outside 
DESTDIR; however, this does make it require some manual configuration after 
installation.

After installing, see /usr/doc/apcupsd-3.14.13/README.SLACKWARE for more
information on how to modify rc.6 and how to start the apcupsd daemon 
automatically at boot.
