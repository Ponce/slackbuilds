# Slackware build script for ttf-ancient-fonts

# Written by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# Notes to self (or anyone else who cares):

# The tarball includes both hinted and unhinted versions of the fonts. The
# Debian package installs <font>.ttf and <font>_hint.ttf for all the
# fonts. However, if I do this, it's impossible to select the _hint
# versions in any application (because the TTF names conflict). Since
# it's possible to disable hinting in fontconfig or specific apps,
# I'm only going to include the _hint versions here by default. User
# can override with HINTS=no. The .otf fonts only come in one variety,
# so they're always installed as-is.

# There are newer versions of these fonts at https://dn-works.com/ufas/
# but they're under what I consider a ludicrously restrictive license,
# so I'm not going to touch them with a 10 foot pole. The symbola-font-ttf
# package is the restrictive version, so I've made it possible to include
# the older (free-to-use) Symbola here, though it's not the default.

# There's no documentation in the tarball, so I borrow it from Debian.
# There's no license info in the tarball, and neither the original site
# nor web.archive.org still has has the "un-Debianized" zip files that
# presumably included the licenses, so I'm including Debian's copyright
# file that asserts these fonts are "free for any use".
