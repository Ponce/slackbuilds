sdltrs (Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P Emulator)

sdltrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Macintosh
OSX, Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the excellent X
Window Unix emulator xtrs. Instead of using the X-Window system for
graphics, it uses the portable SDL library.

Note: When you start up sdltrs for the first time, it attempts
to boot from floppy disk. If you didn't give either the "-disk0
/path/to/image.dsk" or "-nofloppy" options on the command line, it
will "hang" with a black screen, because it's trying to boot from a
nonexistent floppy disc. To recover from this:

- Hold down F10 (TRS-80 Reset) and press Escape (TRS-80 Break key) to
  skip the disk boot and enter the ROM BASIC.

- Press Alt+D to enter the emulator's disk menu, and from there,
  either select a bootable disk image for drive 0, or disable the
  floppy disk controller. Then press Shift-F10 to reboot the TRS-80.

See the man page and the documentation at
/usr/doc/sdltrs-$VERSION/html/index.html for further details.

SlackBuild note: the previous version of this build,
1.2.27+20230518_7dcf4ca9, installed the emulator as "sdl2trs". Now
that upstream has merged the SDL2 port, there's no need for this, and
the executable is called sdltrs. If you have any shortcuts or scripts
using the old name, you'll have to update them.
