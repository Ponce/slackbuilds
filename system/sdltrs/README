sdltrs is a Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P emulator for Macintosh OSX, 
Windows and Linux. It has been ported from the excellent X Window Unix 
emulator xtrs.  Instead of using the X-Window system for graphics, it uses 
the portable SDL library.

A simple sdltrs.desktop file is included that will start sdltrs with the 
default options.  Read the included documentation after installation for 
more information.
