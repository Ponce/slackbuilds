sbotest (sbotools-based reverse dependency build tester)

sbotest uses the sbotools library and sbo-maintainer-tools to build and
test SlackBuilds and their reverse dependencies (zero, one or all
levels). Dry run and package archive features are included. Shared
object dependency checks are available upon build failure.

sbotest is intended to run in a clean-build environment, such as a
virtual machine or Docker image. Because it calls useradd, groupadd and
removepkg non-interactively, using sbotest on a general-purpose
Slackware installation is not recommended.
