sbotest (sbotools-based reverse dependency build tester)

sbotest uses the sbotools library and sbo-maintainer-tools to build and
test SlackBuilds and their reverse dependencies (zero, one or all
levels). Dry run and package archive features are included, as well as
a special option to build-test the entire repository.

Tests for missing shared object dependencies and perl, python and ruby
incompatibility are available upon build failure.

sbotest is intended to run in a clean-build environment, such as a
virtual machine or Docker image. Because it calls useradd, groupadd and
removepkg non-interactively, using sbotest on a general-purpose
Slackware installation is not recommended.
