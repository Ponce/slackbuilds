BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
single small executable.

It provides replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in
GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have
fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave
very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly
complete environment for any small or embedded system.
