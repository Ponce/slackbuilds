Gpart is a small tool which tries to guess what partitions are on a PC type,
MBR-partitioned hard disk in case the primary partition table was damaged.

Gpart works by scanning through the device (or file) given on the command
line on a sector basis. Each guessing module is asked if it thinks a
filesystem it knows about could start at a given sector. Several
filesystem guessing modules are built in.

Supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
DOS/Windows FAT, Linux ext2 and swap, OS/2 HPFS, Windows NTFS,
FreeBSD and Solaris/x86 disklabels, Minix FS, QNX 4 FS, Reiser FS,
LVM and LVM2 physical volumes, BTRFS, BeOS FS, SGI XFS.
