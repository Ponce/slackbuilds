solarize-12x29-psf (large linux console font)

This package provides a large size 512 glyph console font. It is
especially designed for prolonged word processing in multiple languages.

Because this font contains over 256 glyphs, the hardware bold text property
of your console will be turned off.

To make this the system default font, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.font and change
the setfont line to read:

  setfont -v Solarize.12x29

Don't forget to chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.font.
