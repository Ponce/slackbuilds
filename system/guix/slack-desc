# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

guix: GNU Guix provides state-of-the-art package management features such
guix: as transactional upgrades and roll-backs, reproducible build
guix: environments, unprivileged package management, and per-user profiles.
guix: It uses low-level mechanisms from the Nix package manager, but
guix: packages are defined as native Guile modules, using extensions to the
guix: Scheme languageâ€”which makes it nicely hackable.
