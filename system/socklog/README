socklog, in cooperation with the runit package, is a small and secure replacement for syslogd.

It can receive syslog messages from a unix domain socket ("/dev/log") and
write them to various files on disk depending on facility and priority.

It can receive messages from a udp socket ("0.0.0.0:514") and write them to
disk, or forward the messages to another udp socket ("a.b.c.d:514").

svlogd has a built in log file rotation based on file size, 
so there is no need for any cron jobs or similar to rotate the logs.

Check README.Slackware on how to use it after installation.
