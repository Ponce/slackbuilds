Afio makes compressed archives that are safer than compressed tar or
cpio archives, allowing better handling of input data corruption. Afio
also supports multi-volume archives during interactive operation.

Afio makes cpio archives with ASCII-formatted header information (odc).
Where the odc format cannot represent some files and file properties
that could be present on a modern UNIX filesystem, it uses an afio-
specific 'large ASCII' header for the files concerned.
