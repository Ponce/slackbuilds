# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

triggerhappy: triggerhappy (a lightweight global hotkey daemon)
triggerhappy:
triggerhappy: Triggerhappy is a hotkey daemon that operates on a system wide
triggerhappy: scale. It watches all configured input devices for key, switch,
triggerhappy: or button events and can launch arbitrary commands specified by the
triggerhappy: administrator. In contrast to hotkey services provided by desktop
triggerhappy: environments, triggerhappy is especially suited to hardware related
triggerhappy: switches like volume or wifi control; it works independently from
triggerhappy: a specific user being logged in and is also suitable for embedded
triggerhappy: systems that do not have a graphical user interface.
