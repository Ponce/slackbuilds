edid-decode (decode EDID data in human-readable format)

edid-decode decodes EDID monitor description data in human-readable
format. Input may be raw binary files or ASCII text in various formats
(see man page).

EDID data may be read with get-edid (from the read-edid build) or
from the /sys filesystem, e.g. /sys/class/drm/card0-HDMI-A-1/edid (the
filename may vary on your system).

Also, sample EDID data from various displays is included in the
package.  See "/usr/doc/edid-decode-$VERSION/data/".

edid-decode does the same job as the parse-edid command from the
read-edid build, but edid-decode shows more detailed info than
parse-edid. Also, edid-decode is still under development as of
December 2020, while read-edid was last updated in April 2015.
