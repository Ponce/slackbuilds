xdiskusage is a user-friendly program to show you what is using up all
your disk space. It is based on the design of xdu written by Phillip
C. Dykstra <dykstra at ieee dot org>. Changes have been made so it 
runs "du" for you, and can display the free space left on the disk,
and produce a PostScript version of the display.
