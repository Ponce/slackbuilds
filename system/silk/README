Silk is a practical front end to various slackware package management
tools, namely slackpkg, sbopkg, slapt-get and slapt-src.
It implements the more common commands and simplifies the operation
of multiple programs by unifying their syntax and execution.

sbopkg is disabled by default, if you have it installed you can
enable it in the config file ~/.config/silkrc

Please add your user to sudoers in order to use the program.

command-line usage examples:

    silk u         --> update and upgrade installed programs and
                       slackbuilds
    silk s 'name'  --> search for a package or slackbuild 'name'
    silk i 'name'  --> install 'name'
    silk r 'name   --> remove name

A launcher is installed in the programs menu for silk-shell,
which streamlines operations. In this case you can type the commands
directly at the "Silk>" prompt, for example:

    Silk> u

Notes:  'sl' and 'slapt' are symlinks to 'silk'. Use them as aliases.
        This program conflicts with the 'sl' package found in
        SlackBuilds.org,do not install both at the same time.

        Silk is written in Python.
