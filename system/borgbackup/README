borgbackup (deduplicating backup program)

BorgBackup (short: Borg) is a deduplicating backup program.
Optionally, it supports compression and authenticated encryption.

The main goal of Borg is to provide an efficient and secure way to
backup data. The data deduplication technique used makes Borg suitable
for daily backups since only changes are stored. The authenticated
encryption technique makes it suitable for backups to not fully trusted
targets.

Borg is a fork of Attic and is maintained by "The Borg collective".

Optional dependencies:

- llfuse for mounting the archives.
- Sphinx and guzzle_sphinx_theme are required if you wish to build the
  HTML docs. Man pages are always included.
