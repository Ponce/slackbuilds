# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xpipe: xpipe (split input and feed it into the given utility)
xpipe:
xpipe: The xpipe command reads input from stdin and splits it by the given
xpipe: number of bytes, lines, or if matching the given pattern. It then
xpipe: invokes the given utility repeatedly, feeding it the generated data
xpipe: chunks as input. You can think of it as a Unix love-child of the
xpipe: split(1), tee(1), and xargs(1) commands.
