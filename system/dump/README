DUMP (dump and restore backup commands)

Dump examines files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed 
up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. 
Subsequent incremental backups can then be layered on top of the full backup.

The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a 
full backup of a filesystem. Single files and directory subtrees may also be 
restored from full or partial backups in interactive mode.


You might want to read this post by Linus:

Slackware's tar package already has rmt, therefore this SlackBuild
excludes it.

This SlackBuild disables the SELinux functionality and dependency.

Note that Slackware comes with another "restore" command: /usr/sbin/restore
The package built by this SlackBuild however will install: /sbin/restore
Thus you might need to call the dump package restore by its full path.
