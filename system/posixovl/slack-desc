# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

posixovl:
posixovl: posixovl provides a filesystem view that supports various POSIX
posixovl: operations while using an otherwise incapable lower filesystem.
posixovl: Filesystems of various degrees of POSIXness can be utilitzed. VFAT
posixovl: is a common denominator when it comes to cross-compatibility,
posixovl: though NTFS - its features are unused in Linux - would be another
posixovl: possibility. Secondly, potent native POSIX-style filesystems can
posixovl: also be used, though the actual use of doing that remains to be
posixovl: discovered.
