dse-typewriter-font (typewriter-style TrueType font)

dse-typewriter-font is a coding font inspired by early 20th-century
typewriters, with good Unicode coverage.

This font is not the result of any scans or traces of samples, specimens,
or other output from an actual typewriter. It's more like an amalgamation
of old-school typewriter fonts with features semi-arbitrarily picked
from each one, as well as a few not in use on actual typewriters.

Features and Characteristics:

* Relatively low ex-height.
* Coding-friendly distinctive characters: li1| Oo0 `'"
* Elite scale typeface (12 characters per inch at 12-point font size).
* Perfectly useful as a traditional typewriter face for other purposes, if you
  don’t mind the zero (0) having a dot in the middle.
