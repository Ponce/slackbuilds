ciopfs (case insensitive on purpose filesystem)

ciopfs is a stackable or overlay linux userspace file system
(implemented with FUSE) which mounts a normal directory on a regular
file sytem in case insensitive fashion. It's useful for getting around
issues where, say, a game is ported from Linux to Windows but the mods
for that game still expect a case-insenitive filesystem.
