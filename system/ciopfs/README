ciopfs (case insensitive on purpose filesystem)

ciopfs is a stackable or overlay linux userspace file system (implemented
with FUSE) which mounts a normal directory on a regular file sytem in
case insensitive fashion. It's useful for getting around issues where,
say, a game is ported from Linux to Windows but the mods for that game
still expect a case-insenitive filesystem.
