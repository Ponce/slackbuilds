LXDM - GUI login manager for LXDE

LXDM is a lightweight drop-in replacement for GDM or KDM.

By default the gtk+3 version of the greeter is built: to build
the gtk+2 one instead (unsupported), the script can be run as

  GTK3=no ./lxdm.SlackBuild

An additional InduSlack theme (by Sebastien Ballet) is
provided: to avoid including it in the final package pass
the script the parameter WITH_INDUSLACK=no

See README.SLACKWARE for post-installation configuration.
