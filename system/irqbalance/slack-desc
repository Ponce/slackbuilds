# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

irqbalance: IRQBalance (IRQ balancing daemon)
irqbalance:
irqbalance: irqbalance is a Linux daemon that distributes interrupts over the
irqbalance: processors and cores you have in your computer system.  The design
irqbalance: goal of irqbalance is to find a balance between power savings and
irqbalance: optimal performance.  To a large degree, the work irqbalance does
irqbalance: is invisible to you; if irqbalance performs its job correctly, nobody
irqbalance: will ever notice it's there or want to turn it off.
