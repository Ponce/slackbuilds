This is a set of artwiz fonts that is compatible with fontconfig/Xft-2.0.

This script can also build the alternate language versions which contain more
Latin-1 glyphs.  Download the appropriate tarball from the artwiz-aleczapka
website and set $FONTLANG to "de" or "se".  See the SlackBuild script for more
info.  All languages should be able to coexist on the same machine.

After installation you may need to restart X for it to use the new fonts.
