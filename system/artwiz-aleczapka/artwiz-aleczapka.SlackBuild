# All of the fonts advertise themselves as being ISO-8859-1 encoded, although
# some are not.  (CP437 is a better match for some.)  The "en" source has most
# of the ASCII subset complete, and the "de" and "se" sources add a few glyphs
# for Latin-1 characters that are important to those languages.  However these
# alternative languages have the font family and face names suffixed with
# ".de" and ".se" so their usefulness is questionable.
#
# To make a package for fonts other than English, run the script as, for
# example, "FONTLANG=de ./artwiz-aleczapka.SlackBuild".  You will need to
# download the correct tarball and place it in this directory.  See the
# SourceForge download page for the available tarballs.

# This pattern for $DOCS is common to all; the other files seem uninteresting.

# Add a -$FONTLANG suffix to the package name when building one of the
# alternate language packages.  All can be installed simultaneously.
# This fits with the source's theme of suffixing the filenames and the font
# family and face names in the non-English versions.
