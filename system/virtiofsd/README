virtiofsd is a vhost-user virtio-fs device backend written in Rust.

This won't work on a 32bit operating system.

NOTE: if you wish to update virtiofsd yourself you need to create a
tarball first with the vendored versions of the rust dependencies:
to create the "vendor" source dir yourself unpack the virtiofsd
tarball, enter its directory and execute these three commands

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/rust/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  export PATH="/opt/rust/bin:$PATH"
  cargo vendor

then you can create a tarball with

  tar Jcf ../virtiofsd-$VERSION-vendor.tar.xz vendor

this is necessary to avoid downloading stuff during execution of
the SlackBuild.
