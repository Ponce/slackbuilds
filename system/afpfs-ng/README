afpfs-ng (client for Apple Filing Protocol)

afpfs-ng is a client for the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) which will
let you mount and access shared volumes from Mac OS X (or netatalk)
to Linux, BSD and Mac OS X systems. 
There is a FUSE-based client which lets you mount a remote
filesystem.  It is for Linux and FreeBSD.
There is also a simple, command-line AFP client; think about it as
an FTP client for AFP.
