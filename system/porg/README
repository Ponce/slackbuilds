Porg (formerly known as paco), is a program to aid management of software
packages installed from source code.

After the installation of such packages, one is usually left with
having no idea of what it was installed and where it all went, making
it difficult to uninstall the package in the future. Porg was written
to solve this problem in a quite simple fashion.
