# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pwgen: Note: The passwords generated by this program aren't as secure as
pwgen: fully random passwords, but they are certainly better than
pwgen: "password1" or similar :-).
