LightDM is a lightweight, cross-desktop display manager.

A "lightdm" user and group must be set up prior to running this script.
That is - please run the following commands:
  groupadd -g 380 lightdm
  useradd -d /var/lib/lightdm -s /bin/false -u 380 -g 380 lightdm


To load lightdm upon boot:

Edit /etc/inittab. Change the default runlevel from 3 to 4.
Then, edit /etc/rc.d/rc.4 and add the following section:

if [ -x /usr/bin/lightdm ]; then
  exec /usr/bin/lightdm
fi


To enable automatic unlocking of password-protected directories upon
login, pass FSCRYPT=yes to the SlackBuild.
This is useful (ex. when encrypting the /home directory with fscrypt).
