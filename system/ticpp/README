TiCPP is short for the official name TinyXML++. It is a completely
new interface to TinyXML that uses MANY of the C++ strengths.
Templates, exceptions, and much better error handling. It is also
fully documented in Doxygen. It is really cool because this version
lets you interface tiny the exact same way as before or you can
choose to use the new ticpp classes. All you need to do is define
TIXML_USE_TICPP. It has been tested in VC 6.0, VC 7.0, VC 7.1,
VC 8.0, MinGW gcc 3.4.5, and in Linux GNU gcc 3+.
