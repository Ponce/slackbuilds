Solaar is a Linux device manager for Logitech's Unifying Receiver
peripherals. It is able to pair/unpair devices to the receiver, and for
most devices read battery status.

It comes in two flavors, command-line and GUI. Both are able to list the
devices paired to a Unifying Receiver, show detailed info for each
device, and also pair/unpair supported devices with the receiver.

Solaar will detect all devices paired with your Unifying Receiver, and
at the very least display some basic information about them. For some
devices, extra settings (usually not available through the standard
Linux system configuration) are supported.

By default, the udev rule
/etc/udev/rules.d/42-logitech-unifying-receiver.rules
allows all members of the plugdev group to have read/write access to the
Unifying Receiver device.  Therefore, make sure all desktop users are
part of the plugdev group:
usermod -a -G plugdev <username>

After installation, you must physically remove the Unifying Receiver and
re-insert it for the device node permissions to take effect for the
first time.

NOTE: As of 1.0.2 Solaar has moved to python3, so all of its
dependencies must be built with python3 support.
