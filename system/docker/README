Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that
a developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production,
on VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.

To use docker as a limited user, add your user to the 'docker' group:

 	# groupadd -r -g 278 docker
	# usermod -a -G docker <your_username>

This will require logging out and back in. 

To have the docker daemon start and stop with your host,
add to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker start
	fi

and to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown (creating it if needed):

	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.docker ]; then
		/etc/rc.d/rc.docker stop
	fi

NOTE: google-go-lang is only needed at compile time - not needed for runtime.
