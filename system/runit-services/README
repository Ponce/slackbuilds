Contains various services for using with runit.

The services are installed in /etc/sv.

To enable a service, simply symlink it to your service directory, ie,
/service or /var/service.

The default service directory is assumed to be /service.
If its different, RUNITSVDIR can be set while executing the Slackbuild, ie:

# RUNITSVDIR=/var/service ./runit-services.Slackbuild

Service logging is done via runit's svlogd or via syslog as applicable.
tai64nlocal from daemontools is recommended for checking log timestamps.
