Partclone is a program similar to the well-known backup
utility "Partition Image" a.k.a partimage. Partclone
provides utilities to save and restore used blocks on a
partition and is designed for higher compatibility of the
file system by using existing libraries, e.g. e2fslibs is
used to read and write the ext2 partition.
