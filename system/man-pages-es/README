man-pages-es (paginas de manual en Espanol)

Spanish translation of man-pages and man-pages-extra.

LANG should be set to something like es_ES, to see Spanish man pages. UTF-8
doesn't work without editing /usr/lib(64)?/man.conf.

Note that the package maintainer doesn't read Spanish well, so please,
use English if you're sending an email.
