nss-pam-ldap is a Name Service Switch (NSS) module and Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM) that allows your LDAP server to provide
user account, group, host name, alias, netgroup, and basically any
other information that you would normally get from /etc flat files
or NIS.  It also allows you to do authentication to an LDAP server.
