Flexbackup is for you if you have a single or small number of
machines, Amanda is "too much", and tarring things up by hand
isn't nearly enough.

FEATURES:
 o Easy to configure
 o Uses dump, afio, GNU tar, cpio, star, pax, or zip archivers
 o Full and numbered levels of incremental backup (acts like "dump")
 o Compression and buffering options for all backup types
 o Does remote filesystems over SSH
