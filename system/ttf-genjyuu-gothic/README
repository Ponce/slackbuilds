Genjyuu Gothic (源柔ゴシック, Genjū Gosshikku) is a derivative
font that takes the free OpenType font
Source Han Sans (Noto Sans CJK / 源ノ角ゴシック), converts it
to the TrueType format, and applies a process to round its
corners, giving it the appearance of a rounded gothic font.
Both proportional and monospaced families are provided.

This is a repackage of the font for Slackware Linux.
