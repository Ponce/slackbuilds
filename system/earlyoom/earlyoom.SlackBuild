# - add LICENSE and README.md to the doc dir.
# - binary in /usr/sbin, man page in section 8, since this is admin stuff.
# - have the init script delete the PID file after stop or force_stop.
# - actually use SLKCFLAGS.
# - make /etc/default/earlyoom a .new config file.
# - add a bit more detail to README.

# 20230829 bkw: don't generate the man page even if pandoc is installed,
# since we're going to use a prebuilt one.

# 20230829 bkw: no way to do this on the make command line:
sed -i "/^CFLAGS/s,-Wall,& $SLKCFLAGS," Makefile

# 20240808 bkw: fix path to rc file (and remove systemd mention) in
# comments in the /etc/default file.

# 20250923 bkw: it wants to use 'git tag' to get the version number and
# ends up embedding (unknown version), help it out a little.
make VERSION=$VERSION

# 20250923 bkw: 'make install' inconsistent between versions, just boils
# down to this anyway:
install -s -m0755 -D $PRGNAM $PKG/usr/sbin/$PRGNAM

# 20230829 bkw: prebuilt man page is a bit different from the generated one:
# - it's a section 8 page.
# - it has the date and "Linux System Administrator's Manual" filled in.
# - get rid of fancy unicode angle brackets for email addresses, just use <>.
