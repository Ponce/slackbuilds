rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a safe-remove utility for the command line.
Its goal is to conform to the FreeDesktop.org Trash specification and
therefore be compatible with KDE, GNOME, XFCE, and others. Desktop
integration is optional however, and by default, rmw will only use a
waste folder separated from your desktop trash.
