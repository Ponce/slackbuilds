Catapult is a sub-project of openMSX, developed using the tools
SourceForge.net freely offers to open source projects.
The code is stored in Subversion, an open source version management
system. Catapult is released at every openMSX release. It can be
released in between openMSX releases as well, if there is a lot of
development that we want to share with the users without waiting for
the next openMSX release. 

For more information how to configure openMSX and view the users
manual visit its homepage.
