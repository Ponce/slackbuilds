opendune (realtime strategy game)

OpenDUNE is an open source re-creation of the popular game "Dune
II", originally made by Westwood Studios, and released by Virgin
Entertainment. It attempts to re-create the original game and apply
modern technology to it to allow it to be run natively on most
operating systems.

To play the game, you'll need the *.PAK files from the original game.
All three existing versions of the Dune 2 1.07 data files (eu, hs
and us) will work, but the French language will only work with the
eu/hs data files, and the German language will only work with the eu
data files. Copy or symlink the .PAK files from the original game to
"/usr/share/games/opendune/data". The filenames can be uppercase or
lowercase.

Note: the first time you run opendune, it'll show the intro movie,
with no way to skip it. Be patient.

Optional dependencies: TiMidity++ and eawpats. Install these to hear
the in-game music.

Build options:

PULSE: if you don't want to use PulseAudio for the sound, export
PULSE=no in the script's environment. This will use plain ALSA for
the sound.

SDL2: opendune is built with SDL2 by default. If you prefer SDL1 for
some reason, export SDL2=no in the script's environment.

MMX: If you're building a package for a very old x86 system (that
doesn't support MMX), on a newer system (that does support MMX), set
MMX=no in the script's environment. If you're building on the same
system you'll install the package on, you don't have to worry about
this (MMX will be autodetected).
