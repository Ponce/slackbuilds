DGen/SDL is a free, open source emulator for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive systems.
DGen was originally written by Dave, then ported to SDL by Joe Groff and Phil
K. Hornung in 1998.

DGen isn't the best Mega Drive/Genesis emulator out there, but it works and
it's probably the most portable. It's also perfect for command‐line freaks.
