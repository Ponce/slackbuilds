PyChess is a gtk chess client, originally developed for GNOME, but 
running well under all other linux desktops. (Which we know of, at 
least). PyChess is 100% python code, from the top of the UI to the 
bottom of the chess engine, and all code is licensed under the GNU 
Public License.

Optional: gst-python (for sound)
