TinTin++ is a terminal-based MUD/MOO/MUSH client designed to be light
and extensible.  It includes a custom scripting language which supports
event triggers, timers, aliases, and speedwalking among other features. It
also supports the inclusion of external scripting languages such as perl,
python, or ruby via system calls.

TinTin++ supports MCCP (Mud Client Compression Protocol), MMCP (Mud Master
Chat Protocol), xterm 256 colors, most TELNET options used by MUDs, as
well as those required to login via telnet on Linux / Mac OS X servers,
and an auto mapper with a VT100 map display. Being a console client
TinTin++ works with most screen readers, and its non graphical command
interface makes the client particularly screen reader / blind friendly.

Note: Executable is installed as /usr/bin/tt++ by default.
