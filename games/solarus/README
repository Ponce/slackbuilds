Solarus is a free and open-source game engine, licensed under GPL v3.
It is written from scratch in C++ and uses SDL2 (it's not an emulator).
Development began in 2006. The goal of the engine is to allow people
to create their own Action-RPG games (also called Zelda-like games). It
is totally independent from Nintendo.

Solarus will require game data like zsdx.

Optional Dependency

qt5 is an optional dependency for the GUI frontend.

qt5 is *required* if you are going to build solarus-quest-editor.
