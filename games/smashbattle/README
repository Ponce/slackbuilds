So you're up for some fast, old skool, 2D, platform, shoot 'm up action!
Well you came to the right place. Smash Battle, a game based on the famous
Mario battle from Super Mario Bros 3 on the good old NES. The game is simple
yet very addictive. Fight your way through several missions to unlock secret
characters. Battle with one, two or even three friends in the multiplayer mode
to show of your old and dusty game skillz.
