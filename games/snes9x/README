snes9x (Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator)

Snes9x is a portable, freeware Super Nintendo Entertainment System
(SNES) emulator. It basically allows you to play most games designed
for the SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or
Workstation. The games include some real gems that were only ever
released in Japan.

When you first run snes9x:

- The first thing you'll want to do is configure the controls. By
  default there are *no* controls set up; you'll be unable to play any
  games! The config is under Options -> Preferences, in the Joypads
  tab. You can configure either keyboard or joystick/gamepad controls,
  but not both.

- If the game audio is choppy or distorted, try setting the
  sound driver to Pulse or ALSA (Options -> Preferences -> Sound
  tab). Specifically, avoid SDL audio (unfortunately it's the default
  if PULSE=no).

Notes:

- This is not the latest release of snes9x. Version 1.60 crashes under
  pre-15.0 Slackware-current, so version 1.59 is packaged here. This
  will be revisited sometime after Slackware 15.0 is released.

- The package can optionally include the snes9x libretro core, for use
  with RetroArch. By default, the core will be built if RetroArch is
  installed. You can set RETROARCH=yes to force the core to be built,
  or RETROARCH=no to forcibly disable the core. Note that RetroArch
  doesn't have to be installed to build the libretro core, but it's
  useless without RetroArch installed.

- Starting with 1.57, OSS audio is disabled by default. Most users
  won't be affected, since pulseaudio is now the default audio system on
  Slackware, and ALSA is the fallback option. If you *need* OSS support,
  set OSS=yes in the script's environment. You may also disable
  PulseAudio by setting PULSE=no in the environment.
