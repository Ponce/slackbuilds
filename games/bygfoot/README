Bygfoot (A football management game)

This is the stable version of the football (a.k.a. soccer) management game 
Bygfoot. The original concept by Gyözö Both and has been improved wit
h suggestions by players from all over the world. 

Bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and 
selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be 
promoted or relegated, even become a champion if you're a skillful manager.
The game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to 
keep one eye at your players and another at your stadium.

You can customise Bygfoot by writing your own country definition files or 
by creating your own team definition files. See the Definitions forum for 
help and hints.
