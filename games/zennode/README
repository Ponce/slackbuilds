zennode (node builder for Doom and related games)

ZenNode will read the level description from a .WAD file and create
either a new BLOCKMAP resource, REJECT resource, and/or NODES, SEGS,
SSECTOR resources. Levels in a .WAD may be specified on the command
line, or, if none are specified, all of the maps in a .WAD will be
rebuilt.

ZenNode supports Doom, Doom II, Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.

Notes:

- ZenNode does NOT create GL nodes. Use glbsp or zdbsp for that.

- The ZenNode compare utility is installed as /usr/games/zn-compare,
  to avoid conflicting with /usr/bin/compare from ImageMagick.
