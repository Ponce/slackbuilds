Wolfenstein Enemy Territory: Legacy is a project that aims to create
a fully compatible client and server for the popular online FPS game
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

It's based on its source code released under the GPLv3 license.

The main goal of this project is to fix bugs, remove old dependencies
and make it playable on all major operating systems while still
remaining compatible with the ET 2.60b version and as many of its mods
as possible.

This script builds the server with omni-bot support (x86 32bit only).
(http://www.omni-bot.com/)

This command line switches are available:
- RENDERER2=yes (default: no) enable the new renderer (it performs
  better but needs an OpenGL 3.0+ capable GPU; also it's still WIP,
  so enable at your own risk, may cause incompatibilities with some
  maps);
- FREETYPE=yes (default: no) enables freetype support;
- OPENAL=yes (default: no) enables OpenAL support
  (for this you need the optional dependency OpenAL);
- CROUCH=yes (default: no) enables sticky crouching (during game).

To play you *need* also the data files from the original game
(etlegacy-data).

* WARNING *

To have a client/server compatible with the existing ones (to play
on the existing online servers), build it on/for a 32bit platform.
