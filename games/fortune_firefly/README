fortune_firefly (fortunes from the TV series "Firefly")

This package contains fortunes from the TV series "Firefly", and it's
movie "Serenity", by Joss Whedon. The series survived only one season
on Fox; the network scheduled a bad timeslot, played the episodes
out of order, and in general helped seal its fate. Nonetheless, the
series built up a cult following; as DVD sales skyrocketted, Universal
decided to sponsor a movie based on the series.

Firefly is often described as a "Space Western". A mix of humor
and seriousness, it is sometimes described as "Star Wars" with the
Rebellion having been brutally crushed and Han Solo needing a new
job. Over 500 years in the future, a band of humans terraformed a
nearby planetary system with dozens of habitable planets. The most
developed planets, toward the core, live in "civilization", and formed
the Alliance; the planets on the rim tend to struggle to survive,
and launched a failed rebellion against Alliance rule. Captain
Malcolm Reynolds, a former "browncoat" (rebel) commander, captains
a Firefly-class starship named "Serenity", with a small, mostly
loyal crew, taking whatever jobs (legal or otherwise) that they can.
Their lives become more complicated when, after taking on passengers
for cover, they inadvertently take in a mentally disturbed girl who
the Alliance wants more than anything else.
