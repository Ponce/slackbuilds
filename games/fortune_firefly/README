This package contains fortunes from the TV series "Firefly", and it's
movie "Serenity", by Joss Whedon.  The series survived only one season
on Fox; the network scheduled a bad timeslot, played the episodes out
of order, and in general helped seal its fate.  Nonetheless, the series
built up a cult following; as DVD sales skyrocketted, Universal decided
to sponsor a movie based on the series.

Firefly is often described as a "Space Western".  A mix of humor
and seriousness, it is sometimes described as "Star Wars" with
the Rebellion having been brutally crushed and Han Solo needing a
new job.  Over 500 years in the future, a band of humans terraformed
a nearby planetary system with dozens of habitable planets.  The most
developed planets, toward the core, live in "civilization", and formed
the Alliance; the planets on the rim tend to struggle to survive,
and launched a failed rebellion against Alliance rule.  Captain
Malcolm Reynolds, a former "browncoat" (rebel) commander, captains
a Firefly-class starship named "Serenity", with a small, mostly
loyal crew, taking whatever jobs (legal or otherwise) that they can.
Their lives become more complicated when, after taking on passengers
for cover, they inadvertently take in a mentally disturbed girl who the
Alliance wants more than anything else.
