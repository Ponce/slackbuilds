noteye (fontend for roguelike games; includes hydraslayer)

Necklace of the Eye (NotEye in short) is a roguelike frontend. It can
modify the output of console and libtcod roguelikes, and it also works
as a library which allows to easily port old ASCII roguelikes like ADOM
into 21st century.

Hydra Slayer is a Roguelike game focused on one thing: slaying
Hydras. It is inspired by Greek mythology, Dungeon Crawl, MathRL seven
day roguelike, and some mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying
many headed beasts. Hydra Slayer features an original combat system,
based on mathematical puzzles. Since Hydra Slayer is a flagship
roguelike for NotEye, the two are distributed together.

NotEye can be used as a frontend for most of the rogue-like games on
SlackBuilds.org, such as rogue, adom, nethack... try searching the site
