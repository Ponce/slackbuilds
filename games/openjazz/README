OpenJazz is a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit
games. OpenJazz can be compiled on a wide range of operating systems,
including Windows 98/Me/XP and Linux. OpenJazz requires the files
from any of the following games:

- Jazz Jackrabbit Shareware Edition (included in this build)
- Jazz Jackrabbit
- Jazz Jackrabbit CD
- Jazz Jackrabbit Christmas Edition
- Jazz Jackrabbit: Holiday Hare 1995

OpenJazz will not work with any of the Jazz Jackrabbit 2 games.

There is no support for saving/loading the game. Multiplayer
is supported, but not well tested. For more information, see
http://www.alister.eu/jazz/oj/faq.php

This build includes the data files from the shareware edition,
installed in /usr/share/openjazz/shareware, and a wrapper script
openjazz-shareware that runs them (along with a .desktop file that
does the same). To run one of the other supported games, you'll
need an installed/extracted copy of the game in its own directory,
and you'll have to pass the directory path to openjazz as an
argument. Example:

$ openjazz /dosC/games/jazz

Note that all the actual data files need to have UPPERCASE names,
e.g. "BLOCKS.000". If yours are lowercase, you can use something
like this:

$ for i in *; do mv $i $( echo $i | tr a-z A-Z ); done
