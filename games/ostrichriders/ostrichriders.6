.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
ostrichriders [\fI\-l libdir\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Enemy knights are invading the kingdom. As one of the elite ostrich
riders, it is your duty to defend the kingdom. With lance in hand
you fly off. Remember to stay above your opponent lest you fall to
his lance. Collect the eggs lest your opponent hatches stronger than
before. Work together with other knights.
.sp
The game is controlled entirely via the keyboard. Up to 3 players can
play on the same instance of the game (no networked multiplayer). The
menu is operated with arrow keys and Enter, and the gameplay keys are
