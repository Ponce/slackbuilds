jezzball-kazzmir (2d arcade/puzzle game)

Jezzball is a classic game much like Qix, wherein you must create
walls and not get hit by the flying balls. If you create enough walls
to cover 80% of the screen, you go to the next level, where you get
one extra life and another ball trying to kill you.

Left click to create a wall.
Right click to change the direction of the mouse.

This is a clone of the original Jezzball, rewritten by Kazzmir aka
Jon Rafkind. This was originally for Windows, and required some minor
porting to get it to play nice on Linux. See README_Slackware.txt for
details.
