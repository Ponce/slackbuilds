zsnes (SNES emulator)

ZSNES is a Super Nintendo emulator programmed by zsKnight and _Demo_.
On April 2, 2001 the ZSNES project was GPL'ed and its source released
to the public. It currently runs on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and DOS.
Remember that this is a public beta so don't expect this to run on
your machine.

Note to 64-bit users: zsnes can't be built for 64-bit, and it's no
longer practical to provide a static binary as was done in the past.
It should be possible to build zsnes if you install multilib, though
the SlackBuild maintainer hasn't tested this.
