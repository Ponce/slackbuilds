zork (interactive fiction games in z-code format)

Zork was one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with
roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure.

This package includes Zork I, Zork II, Zork III, and Zork: The
Undiscovered Underground (aka "ztuu"). They are owned by Activision,
which released them as free downloads some time ago. The first 3 Zork
games were originally developed by Infocom.

To actually play the games, you'll need a z-code interpreter.
Currently available are frotz and fizmo (text) and zoom (X11). See
README.interpreters for details. This build includes a shell script
wrapper so you can run the games from the XFCE or KDE desktop menu,
or by typing the game name (zork1, zork2, zork3, ztuu) from the shell,
provided you have at least one interpreter installed.

This package includes the InvisiClues from the original games (as
plain text, so beware of spoilers). There are also walkthroughs
and downloadable PDF manuals for the first three games here:
