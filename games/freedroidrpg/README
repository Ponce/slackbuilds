FreedroidRPG is a mature open source sci-fi isometric role playing game.
It strives at providing an immersive ambience backed by refined graphics
and music tracks. Besides the hack'n'slash action phases, dialogs with
dozens of NPCs take care of storytelling. The player can fight with
melee or ranged weapons, take control of his enemies by hacking, and
remotely execute code on enemy robots.
