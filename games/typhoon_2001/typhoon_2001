# Wrapper script for typhoon 2001. This binary-only game was originally
# written for MS Windows, so it expects to find its data files in the
# current directory, and to be able to write log and config files there.

# To allow for system-wide installation, this script will create and
# populate a per-user symlink forest in ~/.$PRGNAM, allowing each
# user to have his own typhoon.cfg and typhoon.log files.
