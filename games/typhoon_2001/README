Typhoon 2001 is a freeware game inspired by both the Atari Jaguar hit
game Tempest 2000 and the arcade hit Tempest. It takes ideas and concepts
from both games, but rearranges and changes them. A few new ideas have
been implemented as well.

To run the Linux version of Typhoon 2001, you will need hardware OpenGL
video accleration support for your X server.

This game is not open source: it's distributed binary-only. The SlackBuild
simply installs the binary distribution files in the appropriate places,
and adds a launcher script in /usr/bin, which adds support for per-user
game settings. The directory $HOME/.typhoon_2001/ will be created the
first time the game is run.
