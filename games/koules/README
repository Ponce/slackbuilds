Koules is a fast action arcade-style game for UNIX and OS/2. This
version supports X window system, SVGAlib  for Linux and OS/2. It
works in fine (up to 900x620) resolution with cool 256 color graphics,
multiplayer mode up to 5 players, full sound and, of course, network
support. Koules is an original idea.  First version of Koules was
developed from scratch by Jan Hubicka in July 1995.

Yes, koules used to packaged on disk y1 of Slackware 3.3. It needed
quite a bit of patching to work well on a modern system...

If you're building this for use on a slow system, try setting MITSHM=yes
in the environment; it may speed things up (or not).

The build patches koules to use ALSA for audio. If you want to disable
the patch and use OSS, set ALSA=no in the environment (probably only
useful if you use OSSv4).

When using ALSA on a stock Slack 14.2 system, the audio will be routed
to pulseaudio, but pulseaudio doesn't get automatically started by
koules. This shouldn't be an issue for KDE or XFCE users (since they
start a persistent pulseaudio daemon at startup), but if you run a
window manager like WindowMaker or FVWM2, you might have to start
pulseaudio manually (or, from your .xinitrc).

If you have Tcl/Tk installed, and you're running KDE, you'll get a nice
GUI launcher dialog when you run Koules from the K menu. If you're not
running KDE, try running "koules-launcher".

Note: When playing as player #2 in multiplayer, the default keys
are WASD, not the arrows (this is confusing). Players 3 and above
don't seem to have default key maps, so be sure to configure the keys
before starting the game (or set the control type to mouse or joystick
instead).
