oblige (random level generator for Doom engine games)

OBLIGE is a random level generator for Doom, Doom II, and their
expansion packs. The goal is to produce high quality levels which are
fun to play.

A Doom engine is required if you actually want to play the levels you
generate. Currently there are builds on SBo for zdoom, gzdoom, prboom,
odamex, skulltag, and maybe a few more. Note that chocolate-doom won't
work with oblige's levels, a limit-removing engine is needed.

Also required: the data file(s) for whichever game(s) you're playing
(registered versions, not shareware):

Game:            File:
Doom             doom.wad
Doom II          doom2.wad
FreeDoom         freedoom.wad, from SBo freedoom build
Ultimate Doom    doom.wad or doomu.wad (?)
TNT Evilution    tnt.wad
Plutonia         plutonia.wad

Older versions of oblige had support for Heretic, Hexen, and Quake. If
you need these, install oblige-legacy4 (which can co-exist with this
version).

Oblige 6 and 7 take completely different approaches to level generation.
Some people might prefer version 6, so this script supports both. By
default, the version in the .info file (currently 7.70) is built. To
build version 6 instead, get oblige-620-source.tar.gz from the author's
site, place it in the SlackBuild directory, and run the script with
VERSION=6.20 in the environment.
