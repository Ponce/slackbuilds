OBLIGE is a random level generator for various classic games, including
DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, and Quake. The goal is to produce high quality
levels which are fun to play.

This requires lua, fltk, and glbsp.

A Doom (or Heretic, or Quake) engine is required if you actually want to
play the levels you generate (currently, prboom and zdoom are available
at SBo).

Also required: the data file(s) for whichever game(s) you're playing
(registered versions, not shareware):

Game:            File:
Doom             doom.wad
Doom II          doom2.wad
Heretic          heretic.wad
Quake            pak0.pak and pak1.pak
