stratagus (RTS game engine)

Stratagus Core is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming
engine. It includes support for playing over the internet/LAN, or playing
a computer opponent. The engine is configurable and can be used to create
games with a wide range of features specific to your needs.

If you're installing stratagus as a dependency for wargus, make sure the
stratagus and wargus version numbers match. This shouldn't be a problem
(both will be updated at SBo at the same time, when needed).

Stratagus was formerly known as FreeCraft and ALE Clone.
