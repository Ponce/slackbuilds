PC Engine SuperGrafx is a NEC PC Engine SuperGrafx video game system
emulator that can be used as a libretro core.

Beetle/Mednafen SGX requires the following BIOS image file for CD
emulation to work:

* syscard3.pce

Any CD-ROM System BIOS will work, but some them are known to be
incompatible with certain games.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./beetle-supergrafx-libretro.SlackBuild
