CRRCSim is a model airplane flight simulation program for Linux with
ports to other platforms. Using CRRCSim you can learn how to fly
model aircraft, test new aircraft designs, and improve your skills by
practicing in the relative safety of your PC. CRRCSim specializes in
thermal and slope soaring simulation, though powered models are also
included.
