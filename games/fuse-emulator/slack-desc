# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fuse-emulator: Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) was originally, and somewhat
fuse-emulator: unsurprisingly, a ZX Spectrum emulator for Unix. However, it has 
fuse-emulator: now also been ported to Mac OS X, which may or may not count as a 
fuse-emulator: Unix variant depending on your advocacy position. It has also been
fuse-emulator: ported to Windows, the Wii, AmigaOS and MorphOS, which are
fuse-emulator: definitely not Unix variants.
