Fuse (the Free Unix Spectrum Emulator) was originally, and somewhat
unsurprisingly, a ZX Spectrum emulator for Unix. However, it has
now also been ported to Mac OS X, which may or may not count as a
Unix variant depending on your advocacy position. It has also been
ported to Windows, the Wii, AmigaOS and MorphOS, which are definitely
not Unix variants.
