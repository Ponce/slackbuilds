oblige-legacy4 (random level generator for classic FPS games)

OBLIGE v4 is a random level generator for various classic games,
including DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, Hexen, and Quake. The goal is to
produce high quality levels which are fun to play.

This is an older version of oblige, with support for Heretic, Hexen,
and Quake. If you want the latest version (7.x), install oblige. It can
coexist with this version, but lacks support for Heretic and Quake. 6.x
also uses a different alrogithm for level generation.

A Doom (or Heretic, Hexen, Quake) engine is required if you actually
want to play the levels you generate. Currently there are builds on SBo
for zdoom, gzdoom, prboom, chocolate-doom, odamex, skulltag, and maybe
a few more.

Also required: the data file(s) for whichever game(s) you're playing
(registered versions, not shareware):

Game:            File:
Doom             doom.wad
Doom II          doom2.wad
FreeDoom         freedoom.wad, from SBo freedoom build
Ultimate Doom    doom.wad or doomu.wad (?)
TNT Evilution    tnt.wad
Plutonia         plutonia.wad
Heretic          heretic.wad
Hexen            hexen.wad
