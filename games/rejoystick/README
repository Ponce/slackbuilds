Rejoystick is a program that maps keypresses on your
gamepad/joypad/joystick to keypresses on a keyboard when you
are running X. Since it uses SDL to communicate with the gamepad
device, it can work on every platform that provides SDL and an
X environment. (Though it is yet to be tested on Cygwin e.g.)
