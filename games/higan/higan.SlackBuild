# 20230108 bkw: fix PRINT_PACKAGE_NAME.
# 20211101 bkw: v106 BUILD=3
# - revert to v106! someone other than me upgraded this for higan
#   v110, but it turns out that v110 wouldn't actually play any games
#   (UI would start up, but no way to map controllers). unless/until I
#   straighten this out, this will remain at v106, which I've actually
#   successfully played games with.
# - new-style icons.
# - better .desktop files.

# 20200907 bkw: upstream source moved and changed to .tar.gz, get
#               rid of p7zip dependency. BUILD=2.
# 20200529 bkw: add "can't update version" note to README.
# 20181211 bkw:
# This update would not have happened without assistance and moral support
# from Yossi Ne'eman. Thanks!
# - Take over maintenance.
# - Update for v106.
# - Use the gtk frontend, not the *broken* qt one.
# - Make OpenAL dep optional & autodetected (and OPENAL=no to force-disable).
# - Add OSS (default no) and PULSE (default yes) env vars.
# - Fix permissions of the stuff installed to /usr/share/higan: everything
#   was executable, ugh.
# - Install binary in /usr/games (it's a game system emulator, people).
# - Update the README, include link to the semi-official doc site.
# - Update slack-desc with current list of supported systems.
# - Add man pages. Note to SBo admins: please don't remove my *.rst man
#   page sources!

# 20181212 bkw: switch from hiro=qt to hiro=gtk. I have no idea why the
# original author chose qt... the qt frontend is known to be buggy in v106
# (per upstream's git log). Issues I ran into were segfaulting on exit,
# and sometimes the Settings tabs wouldn't get painted... which are both
# mentioned as known issues in the git log. There are some post-106
# commits that may fix the qt issues; we'll see, when 107 is released.
