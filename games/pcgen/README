PCGen helps you build characters for role-playing games like
[D&D](http://dnd.wizards.com) and
[Pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG).

It's a digital character sheet that handles all the tricky and tedious
parts of building characters. You can use it to build one character
for yourself, or to keep track of a dozen NPCs for a game world.

This SlackBuild.org installs from the binary distribution, so it's
available for x64 only.
