# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

xu4: xu4 (Ultima IV remake)
xu4:
xu4: XU4 is a remake of the computer game Ultima IV. The goal is to make
xu4: it easy and convenient to play this classic on modern operating
xu4: systems.
xu4:
xu4: XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
xu4: recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics. If you
xu4: are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
xu4: it -- yet. New features that improve the gameplay and keep with the
xu4: spirit of the original game will be added.
