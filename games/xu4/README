XU4 is a remake of the computer game Ultima IV.  The goal is to make
it easy and convenient to play this classic on modern operating
systems.

XU4 isn't a new game based on the Ultima IV story -- it is a faithful
recreation of the old game, right up to the crappy graphics.  If you
are looking for a game with modern gameplay and graphics, this is not
it -- yet.  New features that improve the gameplay and keep with the
spirit of the original game will be added.

This package can be built with optional extras. See README-SBo.txt
for details.

Copyright notice: The file ultima4.zip is included in this package. This
file and its contents have a proprietary license and MAY NOT be
redistributed. You may download it from the original site, but not give
out copies of it yourself (including binary packages built from this
SlackBuild, since they include ultima4.zip).

If you have trouble downloading ultima4.zip from the URL listed
in the .info file, you can instead download UltimaIV.zip from
http://www.ultimaforever.com/ (registration required, JavaScript browser
required, no direct download URL). It's a different packaging of the
same content; the script is smart enough to build a package from either
release of Ultima 4.
