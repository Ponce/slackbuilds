.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B XU4
is a remake of the computer game Ultima IV.  The goal is to make
it easy and convenient to play this classic on modern operating
systems. 
.PP
This man page only describes the command\-line options and keyboard commands
supported by \fBu4\fR.
For full documentation, see the files in \fI/usr/doc/xu4\-@VERSION@/\fR. The
README is a good place to start. Also the "History of Britannia" and the "Book
of Mystic Wisdom" are found there (you should read them before playing).

\fBu4\fR accepts the following options:
.TP
.B "\-f, \-\-fullscreen"
Run in fullscreen mode.

.TP
.B "\-p <profname>, \-profile <profname>"
Activate a specific save game profile.  Using this
option, you may have multiple saved games at the
same time. Also, the game's config is stored on

have e.g. different screen resolutions.

include spaces.
All profiles are stored in the

sub\-directory.
The active profile name is shown on the
introduction map view off the main menu.
