FlightGear is a flight-simulator created by an international group of
volunteers, and released as free, open-source GPL software.
It has been used for academic research, education, and for fun.

This build now includes the internal Qt launcher.  To launch FlightGear
from a terminal window, run 'fgfs --launcher' from the command line.
(This is how the .desktop file launches it.)

If you prefer, you can install either fgo or ffgo as a more basic
launcher.  They will launch fgfs directly without the '--launcher'
parameter.

flite is an optional dependency for voice communication (autodetected
at build time).
