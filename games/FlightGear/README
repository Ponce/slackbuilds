FlightGear is a flight-simulator created by an international group of
volunteers, and released as free, open-source GPL software.
It has been used for academic research, education, and for fun.

To build the internal Qt launcher, you will require QT5 and libxkbcommon
and then pass QT5=yes to the script

To enable voice ATC, you will need flite (autodetected at build time).
