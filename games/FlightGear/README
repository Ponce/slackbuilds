FlightGear is a flight-simulator created by an international group of
volunteers, and released as free, open-source GPL software.
It has been used for academic research, education, and for fun.

This build includes the internal Qt launcher.  To launch FlightGear
from a terminal window, run 'fgfs --launcher' from the command line.
(This is how the .desktop file launches it.)

If you prefer, you can install either fgo (python2) or ffgo (python3)
as a more basic launcher.  They will launch fgfs directly without the
'--launcher' parameter.

This package now includes the FlightGear-data package, so there is no
longer a need to build two separate packages.

flite is an optional dependency for voice communication (autodetected
at build time).

Note that the source has been moved from Sourceforge to Gitlab.

NOTE: FlightGear will build and run in 32-bit, but you will most likely
have to set your graphics settings fairly low to get any kind of decent
framerate.

BIG FAT NOTE: 2024.1.1 is the LAST version that will build in 15.0.
