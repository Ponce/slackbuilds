# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

fgo: FGo! (a simple and fast front end for FlightGear Flight Simulator)
fgo:
fgo: FGo! is a simple and fast graphical front end for FlightGear, written
fgo: in Python by Robert Leda. It combines a simple graphical interface,
fgo: where users can select an aircraft, airport, runway, parking position
fgo: and scenario, with a text window which provides a way to specify more
fgo: advanced command-line options that will be passed to FlightGear. These
fgo: features allow FGo! to keep a minimalist but powerful design.
