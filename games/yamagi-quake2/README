This is an enhanced client for Id Software's legendary Quake II.  It focuses on
single-player. Features include rock-solid stability and AMD64 support.

OpenAL is a recommended optional dependency. Install it first, then
do:

	WITH_OPENAL=yes ./yamagi-quake2.SlackBuild

Before playing, copy your Quake2 data files into the appropriate subdirectories
of /usr/share/quake2.  Please refer to the README files in
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-5.31/ for details.

To get a reasonable default configuration, copy
/usr/doc/yamagi-quake2-5.31/yq2.cfg to your baseq2 directory.
