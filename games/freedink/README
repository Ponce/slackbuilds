Freedink is a free role play game in real. You take
control of Dink Smallwood and guide through his many adventures.
There are many battles to fought and riddles to be solved.
You can install additional advanture through additional D-Mods
which are available at https://www.dinknetwork.com.

Known issues:
- Freedink might start in a maximized, not resizable window. Parts of
  it may be outside the Desktop. If this happens then start the
  program from CLI in windowed mode:

    freedink -i -w

  Afterwards you can switch to fullscreen by pressing Alt+Enter.

- Not all music will be available. See this review (bottom) for
  some more info on this matter:

Optional dependency:
- upx
  If upx is installed on the system then it is automatically
  detected and considered at compile time.

  If for some reason this is not desired then the script
  should be called as

    ENABLE_UPX=no ./freedink.Slackbuild

  If UPX resides in a non-standard location then it
  can be provided by setting

    UPX=/path/to/upx ./freedink.Slackbuild
