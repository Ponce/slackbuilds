colem (ColecoVision emulator)

ColEm is a portable emulator of the old ColecoVision videogame console.
It should run most ColecoVision games and supports Coleco's SuperAction
controllers with spin wheels.

ColEm uses OSS for audio, so you'll have to either load the OSS emulation
modules (via /etc/rc.d/rc.alsa-oss), run it as "aoss colem" from the
command line, or launch it from your desktop by opening a .cv or .col file
(which will use aoss automatically).

In order to run ColecoVision games, you will need a copy of the system
ROM image, but for copyright reasons, no ROM image is included.
The file is generally called "coleco.rom" or "coleco.zip" (which
contains "coleco.rom"). If you own a ColecoVision console, depending
on the laws where you live, it may or may not be legal for you to use a
copy of the ROM. If it's legal, you can either crack open your console,
remove the ROM chip, and read the data from it... or use google-fu to
find an already-dumped image file. Legal issues aside, you have 2 ways
to provide the ROM image for the emulator to use:

1. Buld the package with the ROM image:

  Place either "coleco.rom" or "coleco.zip" (containing "coleco.rom")
  in the directory with the SlackBuild script. The resulting package will
  include the ROM image in "usr/share/colem/coleco.rom". If you do this,
  DO NOT give anyone a copy of the package! Using the ROM might possibly
  be legal, but bundling it with ColEm is against the ColEm license.

2. Build the package without the ROM image:

  After installing the package, manually place a copy of "coleco.rom" in
  "/usr/share/colem/" or "~/.colem/".
