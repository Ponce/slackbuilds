# Slackware build script for colem

# Written by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20210220 bkw: updated for 5.5.
# 20201026 bkw:
# - updated for 5.4.
# - make the slack-desc say whether or not the ROM is included.
# - update the man page with new options in 5.4.

# 20191202 bkw: updated for 4.8.
# 20180619 bkw: updated for 4.6.

# 20171218 bkw: updated for 4.2.
# - upstream started using PulseAudio, but I want to be able to build
#   with or without it, so added PULSE=no option.

# 20170819 bkw:
# - updated for 4.1. according to upstream's docs, the only changes from
#   4.0 to 4.1 are for windows, so don't expect any new features here.

# 20170627 bkw:
# - updated for 4.0
# - rework rom_path.diff, so this script can't build 3.8 any more
# - update man page, add new -4x3 option

# 20161017 bkw:
# - updated for 3.8
# - updated man page with new 3.8 options

# 20160729 bkw:
# - updated for 3.7
# - rom_path.diff now handles filenames longer than 20 characters.

# 20150506 bkw:
# - updated for 3.3. Lots of little changes, meaning the script
#   won't work for 2.9 any more.
# - stop the CRLF madness, extract with 'unzip -aa' and get rid of
#   the carriage returns in rom_path.diff.
# - get rid of POD warnings when making man page.

# 20140825 bkw:
# - updated for 2.9
# - include icon in slackbuild dir (upstream removed it from src tarball)
# - use ColEm.html from the source (upstream includes it now)
# - get rid of DISPLAY_BPP stuff, bpp is now detected at runtime,
#   tested same binary on 16bpp and 32bpp, doubt anyone still uses 8bpp
# - host source myself, since upstream doesn't keep old releases
# - convert man page to .pod, for easier editing
# - install binary in /usr/games, man page in section 6
# - don't unzip the system ROM to $CWD (it might be read-only)
# - support ROM images with alternate name os7.rom
# - clean up README formatting, get rid of bpp stuff, mention OSS audio
# - add a generic-icon to colem.xml, at least in XFCE this makes .col
#   files show up with the colem icon.
# - improve the .desktop file:
#   + don't display in the start menu (since a ROM argument is required)
#   + auto-associate with colecovision ROMs (as defined in colem.xml)
#   + run "aoss colem" to get audio working on a stock Slack 14.1 system
#     with OSS modules disabled by default.
