<H1>New in This Version</H1>
</A>
<UL>
<LI>Yet again ported ColEm to Unix using the new EMULib
    framework. The new <B>ColEm-Unix</B> has been tested to compile
    and run on Ubuntu Linux but should work on any other Unix.
    ColEm-Unix source code is included with the core source code
    distribution.
<LI>Ported ColEm to Maemo OS2008 used in N800 and N810 internet tablets
    from Nokia. <B>ColEm-Maemo</B> has been specifically optimized for
    the tablets using ARM assembler. It will simulate joypad with the
    touch screen and automatically open <CODE>*.cv/*.cv.gz</CODE> files
    from the file manager. ColEm-Maemo source code is included with the
    core source code distribution.
<LI>Renamed <CODE>-zoom/-nozoom</CODE> to <CODE>-soft/-nosoft</CODE>.
<LI>Added <CODE>-scale</CODE> option to scale window on Unix.
<LI>Added <CODE>-home</CODE> to set home directory with system ROMs. 
<LI>Options <CODE>-tv/-notv</CODE>, <CODE>-soft/-nosoft</CODE>, and the
    <CODE>[F8]</CODE> key now work for both MSDOS and Unix.
<LI>ColEm-Symbian display routines rewritten in ARM assembler for speed. 
<LI>Split ColEm-Symbian configuration menu into four tabs, making
    "Video" and "Audio" settings separate.
<LI>Added "Audio Latency", "Skip Frames", and "Sync Updates" settings
    to ColEm-Symbian.
<LI>Documentation and built-in help changed, many inconsistencies removed.

<H1>Introduction</H1>
</A>
<P>
  ColEm is a portable emulator of the old ColecoVision videogame console.
It should run most ColecoVision games and supports Coleco's SuperAction
controllers with spin wheels. You can always get the latest ColEm binaries,
source code, and support files from
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<A HREF="http://fms.komkon.org/ColEm/">http://fms.komkon.org/ColEm/</A>
</P>
<P>
There are versions of ColEm for many platforms, with Windows, MSDOS, Unix,
and Symbian ports being maintained by myself. All these ports are available
for free from the above website.
</P>
<P>
The ColEm-Symbian port works on the 3rd Edition Series60 phones from
Nokia and its licensees. You can download it, as well as my other
Symbian products, at
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<A HREF="http://fms.komkon.org/EmuSymbian/">http://fms.komkon.org/EmuSymbian/</A>
</P>
<P>
ColEm is written in portable C and thus can be ported to any sufficiently
fast computing platform. The current ColEm source code distribution includes
portable core sources and platform-specific sources for Windows and MSDOS.
The ColEm-Unix sources are also available, for a slightly older version
of ColEm.
</P>
<P>
If you would like to port ColEm to another system or make changes in
ColEm's code, <U>please</U>, contact me by email or some other means. Be
aware that ColEm source code is freely distributable, but it is <U>not</U>
public domain and it is <U>not</U> released under GPL. You can not use it
for commercial purposes, distribute, or change it on your own, unless you
contact me to arrange the conditions of such use and get my permission.
Feel free to look at it though.

<H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1>
</A>
<OL>
<LI><B>Why is the emulator so slow on my PC?</B>
<P>
Your computer may be too slow to run the emulator. On slow machines, try
speeding things up by skipping more frames (<CODE>-skip</CODE> command
line option or "Draw XX% frames" menu option). In ColEm-Windows, make
window smaller or switch to the full screen mode with
<CODE>[Alt]+[Enter]</CODE>.
</P>
<LI><B>Emulator is too fast on my PC!</B>
<P>
If ColEm is too fast on your computer, you can slow it down by syncing it
to a timer (<CODE>-sync</CODE> in ColEm-Unix), VBlanks (<CODE>-vsync</CODE>
in ColEm-MSDOS), or by choosing  "PAL Video"/"NTSC Video" menu option in
ColEm-Windows.
</P>
<LI><B>I can't get some ROM images to work with the emulator.</B>
<P>
If you can't get ROM image to work, send it to me for analysis. 
</P>
<LI><B>Is it legal to spread cartridge ROMs?</B>
<P>
<U>NO</U>. Nobody seems to care though, mainly because there is no
profit to be made from ColecoVision software any longer. Nevertheless, be
aware of the fact that by using commercial software you haven't bought you
are commencing an act of piracy.
</P>
<LI><B>When compiling ColEm-Unix, I get "undefined name" errors.</B>
<P>
This usually means that your linker cannot find the necessary libraries
(namely, libX11 and libXext) or some additional libraries (like libsocket
and libnsl) are required. Find these libraries in your system and modify
the Makefile so that the final invocation of the C compiler has
<CODE>-L&lt;path_to_libs&gt;</CODE> options. If you have no libXext
library and the same functionality isn't provided in libX11, try
#undefining the <CODE>MITSHM</CODE> option.
</P>
<LI><B>When starting ColEm-Unix, I get X_ShmAttach error.</B>
<P>
You are probably trying to run the emulator on a remote Xterminal while
it attempts to use shared memory for interfacing with X. Another reason
for this error may be the lack of MITSHM extension support in your
Xserver. Use <CODE>-noshm</CODE> option to disable the usage of shared
memory.
</P>
<LI><B>When starting ColEm-Unix, I get X_PutImage error.</B>
<P>
Unix/X version of ColEm can currently be compiled for 8bit, 16bit, or
32bit Xterminals. Neither 1bit nor 4bit Xterminals will work with the
drivers included into official ColEm distribution.
