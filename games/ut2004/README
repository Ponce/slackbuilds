Reload, rev up and ride out. The new Tournament is faster, higher and meaner. Land and air based
vehicles take combat to a new level; while an arsenal of new weaponry, daunting arenas and battlefields
and the challenge of the Assault and Onslaught modes make the gladiator blood sport of the future a
brand new experience. Buckle up it's gonna be one hell of a ride!

Notes:

This takes the installer (which has the latest version) from Linux Installers For Linux Gamers and
nicely installs it into a package following Slackware standards. This SlackBuild should detect if
you're playing on a 32-bit or 64-bit system and install the correct bins.

Your game data (and mods) must go into "/usr/share/games/ut2004". There is a home folder (.ut2004) for 
your configs, but you'll need to be able to modify the contents located under the share/games folder.
You should have permissions to modify this folder with the games group.

It's probably best to put the game data downloaded from Steam or from your CDs in
"/usr/share/games/ut2004" before installing this SlackBuild.

You'll need to create a file named, "CDkey" in the "/usr/share/games/ut2004/System" directory. And in
it, you need to provide the cd key you have from Steam or the retail box. Otherwise the game will
fail to launch.

The mod selection menu is broken, you'll need to launch mods with a parameter. Here is an example with
Killing Floor: ut2004 -mod=KFMod20
