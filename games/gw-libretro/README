Game & Watch is a libretro core that runs Game & Watch simulators.

It runs simulators converted from source code for the games available
at MADrigal. Each simulator is converted with pas2lua, which was
written specifically for this purpose, and uses bstree, which was also
specifically written to obfuscate the generated Lua source code as per
MADrigal's request.

Games for this emulator are downloadable from the RetroArch gui.

To build the debugging symbols use:
