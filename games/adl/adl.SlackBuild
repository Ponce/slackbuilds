# Slackware build script for adl

# 93 (1993) is the timestamp of the tarball. Most of the files
# inside are stamped May 10 1991, and the copyright notice
# says 1987.

# In case anyone's wondering: compiled ADL files are NOT architecture
# independent. 32-bit adlcomp produces files that won't run on a 64-bit
# adlrun, and vice versa.

# 20180122 bkw: It turns out that adl development continued up
# through 2011, with a Windows and Linux binary release in 2003.
# The ADL language and bytecode formats were changed for the 2003
# binary release, and changed again afterwards. For maximum
# compatibility, I'm now including 3 versions of adl in the package.
# If the code in this script hurts your head, don't feel too bad,
# mine's aching right now.

# 20170621 bkw: add -j1 to the make commands. I got a mysterious
# build failure that I couldn't duplicate, hopefully this fixes it.

# Patch does this:
# - fix various compile errors (mostly relating to lack of ANSI prototypes).
# - remove 'extern char *malloc()' and such, include system headers instead.
# - add support for OPTFLAGS (instead of hard-coded -O in CFLAGS).
# - -DADL_NAME="/usr/games/adlrun93" (for adlcomp's emitted shebang lines).
# - stop adlrun from opening game files read/write: it never writes to them,
#   and the open fails for e.g. non-root user trying to run /usr/games/aard.

### Next, the 2003 binary-only release. No man pages, almost no docs,
#   and don't install compiled sample games. The "64-bit" binaries are
#   actually statified (static) 32-bit, which MUST NOT be stripped!
#   AFAICT, this is the most commonly used version in the ADL community,
#   so these get symlinked to the bare names (adlrun03 => adlrun).

# Bonus tutorial for hardcore SlackBuilders:
# The shebang line is hard-coded in adlcomp, but sed works on binaries,
# and we can use it to change the compiled-in string.
# The rules for doing this:
# 1. All occurrences of the text to replace will be changed, so make
#    sure either (a) it occurs only once, or else (b) you really do want
#    them all changed.
# 2. Replacement must be shorter than the original text.
# 3. Replacement must end with \x00. This is the famous NUL terminator
#    that C uses to terminate strings.
# 4. Only replace as many original characters as the replacement length,
#    including the NUL terminator.
# 5. The modified binary *must be* **exactly** the same size in bytes as
#    the original was. If not, you didn't follow rules 1-4 correctly!
# 6. If you're dealing with non-ASCII character encoding (e.g. UTF-8 or
#    UCS-2), make *damn sure* you know what you're doing! It's possible
#    but not necessarily straightforward. ASCII is easier (one byte is
#    one character).
# In the line below, the full original text was plain ASCII,
# "/users/cunniff/bin/adlrun". We only replace "/users/cunniff/bin/a". The
# \x00 terminates the string, replacing the "a", and the rest of the
# original text ("dlrun\x00") is left as-is in the binary (C code will
# ignore anything after the first \x00, so it just acts as padding).

sed -i 's,/users/cunniff/bin/a,/usr/games/adlrun03\x00,' adlcomp

# DO NOT strip these. The pseudo-64-bit binaries break if you do,
# because they're actually 32-bit pseudo-static, created by statifier.
# "file" shows them as "dynamically linked" but "ldd" says they're not,
# and strip gets powerfully confused by this state of affairs.
