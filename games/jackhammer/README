Jackhammer is a brand new level editor for games with a quake-style BSP architecture. The aim is to
develop a convenient cross-platform tool capable of incorporating the best features of existing
editors, such as Valve Hammer Editor, Q3Radiant and others. Despite Quake and Half-Life having been
released a long time ago, the large community have arisen around, still developing mods and games on
their bases. However the existing editors suffer from fundamental disadvantages their users are well
familiar with. Jackhammer does aspire to be the universal level design tool for classic games.
