Hedgewars is a turn based strategy game.

Each player controls a team of several hedgehogs. During the course 
of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They 
then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill
the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game. Each turn is 
time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with 
excessive thinking or moving.

This requires lua and fpc.

This SlackBuild packages only the game itself. If you want to compile
the server, you will need to provide additional dependencies.
Please, refer to the documentation in the source tarball.
