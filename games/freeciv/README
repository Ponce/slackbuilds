Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of the Civilization(R) series by Microprose(R) should feel at home,
since one aim of Freeciv is to have optional modes (called rulesets) with
compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and
is easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there! That also
means it has very extensive multilanguage support, something rare in games.

Note: Building this on Slackware64, it complains about a missing mikmod lib.
This is actually a little bug in Slackware64 that I reported to Patrick.
The library is not needed at all, but the libSDL_mixer.la file incorrectly
states it as a dependency. On 32-bits Slackware this does not happen.

This requires libmikmod to compile on Slackware64.
