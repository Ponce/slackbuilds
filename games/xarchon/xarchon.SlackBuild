# Slackware build script for xarchon

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20211015 bkw: BUILD=3
# - fix build on -current.
# - new-style icon.
# - TODO: fix segfault when built with -O2. For now, the band-aid is
#   to build with -O0.

# note: xarchon plays Archon and Archon II: Adept. I can't tell if the
# Adept game is complete or correct, because I never could understand
# how to play it, even as a video-game-obsessed kid in the 1980s.

# further note, written later: no, Adept is nowhere near complete or
# playable. So I'm patching the game to remove the menu option for it.

# 20211015 bkw: on -current, with gcc12, the damn thing segfaults
# on startup when we use -O2 (or -O1 even). Since it's only a game,
# I won't spend a lot of time worrying about it. It won't compile with
# clang++ either (not even with -std=gnu++98). The *real* fix for this
# is going to be to port xarchon to qt5. Which is beyond the scope
# of this SlackBuild, but I might take a stab at it as a standalone
# project someday.

# disable Adept menu option, since it's non-playable.

# theoretically xarchon can be built with gtk+-1.x, but it requires an
# ancient gtk1-compatible version of glade... plus the gtk1 stuff won't
# compile under gcc-5.3. went through the trouble of patching the qt UI,
# so we don't bother with gtk1.
patch -p1 < $CWD/patches/remove_gtk.diff

# stop the GUI from getting stuck in Configure Players, when no joysticks
# are plugged in. Without the patch, it continually complains "Joystick
# not available" and won't allow saving the settings, even if joystick
# control isn't selected. With the patch, it still complains, but only
# once (per human player), then it saves the settings and exits Configure
# Players correctly.
patch -p1 < $CWD/patches/joystick.diff

# remove "Select Theme" from the menu. it's unimplemented, plus there
# aren't any themes to choose (just the default one).
patch -p1 < $CWD/patches/remove_theme_option.diff

# add warning to the man page about the GUI section being outdated,
# remove mention of selecting themes.
