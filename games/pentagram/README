Pentagram is a project aiming to create an Ultima 8 engine for use on
modern operating systems, including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

While it is currently possible to finish Ultima 8 using Pentagram,
not everything is fully working yet. (Save regularly!) In the game
itself, most notably, the combat AI of monsters is still very limited,
and there are still quite a few minor things which are not working as
well as they should.

Optionally, pentagram can use TiMidity++ or fluidsynth for in-game music
(detected at compile time, must be enabled in pentagram.ini or in-game
menu).

Pentagram is only an engine. To actually play the game, you will
need an installed copy of "Ultima VIII: Pagan". Either copy the
game directory (the one containing u8.exe) to /usr/share/pentagram
(so that /usr/share/pentagram/u8.exe exists), or edit the 'path=' in
~/.pentagram/pentagram.ini to point to your existing game directory.
Pentagram is smart enough to ignore the case of filenames, so U8.exe or
U8.EXE would also be OK.

YOU MUST OWN THE GAME in order to play it with pentagram. Do not contact
pentagram's authors or the author of this SlackBuild asking for illegal
copies of Ultima 8: such requests will be ignored, at best.
