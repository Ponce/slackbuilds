.SH NAME
\fBpentagram\fR \- A reimplemented engine for the game
.B Ultima VIII: Pagan

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pentagram
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pentagram
is an engine for playing the game
.B Ultima 8
on modern operating systems.
The files from the original game are required for
.B pentagram
to work. Since
.B Ultima 8
is a commercial work, this means you must own a
copy of the original game to legally play it with
\fBpentagram\fR.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Shows command\-line option help
.TP
.B \-q
Silence general logging messages.
.TP
.B \-qq
Silence general logging messages and non\-critical
warnings/errors.
.TP
.B \-\-game [gamename]
Select a game. This option is currently useless, since only Ultima 8 is supported.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.pentagram/
Config and savegame data.
.TP
.B ~/.pentagram/pentagram.ini
Configuration. Specifies the path to the game data, among other things.
The SlackBuilds.org build of pentagram uses a shell script wrapper to
create a default \fBpentagram.ini\fR if the user doesn't have one already.
For full details of the options available in the config file, see:
.br
\fI/usr/doc/pentagram\-@VERSION@/README\fR
.TP
.B ~/.pentagram/u8\-save/
Saved games. Not compatible with the original Ultima 8.
.TP
.B /usr/share/games/pentagram
This is the default location where
.B pentagram
looks for the Ultima 8 data files. This directory should contain
a complete installation of the game, including the file
.B U8.exe
(case\-insensitive;
.B u8.exe
or
.B U8.EXE
are also OK). This location can be changed by editing
.B ~/.pentagram/pentagram.ini
