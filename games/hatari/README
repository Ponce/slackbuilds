hatari (Atari ST/STE/Falcon emulator)

Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/Falcon emulator for Linux, BSD, BeOS, Mac OS
X and other systems that are supported by the SDL library. The Atari
ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by Atari
in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer
having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.

Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good
environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the
hardware of an ST as close as possible so that it is able to run most
of the old ST games and demos.

Optional dependencies:

hatari_tos_roms - hatari includes a free ROM replacement called EmuTOS,
but most applications (especially games) will require the real ROM
images. *Highly* recommended.

libcapsimage - Required if you want hatari to support KyroFlux IPF and
CTR disk images. Recommended, but creates non-redistributable package
(mixing GPL and no-commercial-use code). Autodetected.

portaudio - Only used for emulated Falcon microphone support.
            Autotetected.

portmidi - May offer better MIDI support than the default ALSA raw MIDI
           device support. Autodetected.

Build option: if you for some reason want to build hatari with SDL-1.2
rather than 2.0, export SDL2=no in the script's environment.
