d2x-rebirth is a source port of the Descent 2 Engine for Windows,
Mac OS and Linux offering OpenGL graphics and effects, advanced 
Multiplayer, many improvements and new features.

You will need the game data files to actually use d2x-rebirth, 
place these in /usr/share/games/d2x-rebirth or ~/.d2x-rebirth. 
Details of how to extract the correct game files are in the file 
INSTALL.txt. For enhanced gameplay I would suggest you also 
consider downloading the enhanced soundtrack 'AddOn pack' from 
the dxx-rebirth site.

d2x-rebirth requires scons and physfs, both available on SBo.
