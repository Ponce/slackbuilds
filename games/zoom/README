zoom (play interactive fiction games)

Zoom is a player for Z-Code stories or games. These are usually text
adventures ('interactive fiction'), and were first created by Infocom
with the Zork series of games. Throughout the '80s, Infocom released
many interactive fiction stories before their ambitions to enter the
database market finally brought them low.

There is also a selection of freeware Z-Code games here:

Note: This is not video conferencing software! For that, you want
network/zoom-linux. It's also not a magnifier for X. For that, you
want accessibility/xzoom.
