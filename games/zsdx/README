The Legend of Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is set to be a direct sequel to
The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past on the SNES, using the same graphics
and game mechanisms. Zelda Mystery of Solarus DX is the first game made with
the Solarus engine and in fact, Solarus was primarily designed for this game.

Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is actually an enhanced remake of a first creation,
Zelda: Mystery of Solarus. This first creation, developed with RPG Maker 2000,
was released in 2002 and was only available in French. The DX project was unveiled
on April 1st, 2008. Its objectives are to correct the many flaws of its predecessor:
the battle system, the bosses, the use of items, etc.

However, that is hardly all of it as new graphical elements and musics will accompany
you throughout the game. This Deluxe version will be the opportunity for players to
relive the adventure in a brand new way, or to discover it for the first time if youâ€™ve
never played it before!
