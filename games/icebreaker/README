icebreaker (jezzball-like game for Linux, with a penguin theme)

So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You
have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland,
where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.

The binary is installed setgid games: not a serious security risk, but
something to be aware of, if you're paranoid.
