Nestopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. It
strives for the most accurate emulation possible at the pixel-by-pixel
and sample-by-sample level. It was also one of the inspirations for
bsnes.

A 1Ghz CPU and 128MB RAM are required to get the best performance.

A Disk System BIOS (disksys.rom) is optional and, of course, not
included. If you have one, put it in ~/.nestopia

This builds both the standalone application and the Libretro core (for
use with RetroArch). To use the Libretro core, one step is to copy the
following file to your RetroArch BIOS directory:

    /usr/share/nestopia/NstDatabase.xml

Enable GTK GUI needs newer version of gtk3 (default GTK=no)

GTK=yes ./nestopia.SlackBuild
