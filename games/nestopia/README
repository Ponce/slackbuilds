Nestopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. It
strives for the most accurate emulation possible at the pixel-by-pixel
and sample-by-sample level. It was also one of the inspirations for
bsnes.

A 1Ghz CPU and 128MB RAM are required to get the best performance.

A Disk System BIOS (disksys.rom) is optional and, of course, not
included. If you have one, put it in ~/.nestopia

Since 1.51, nestopia need fltk from Slackware's /extra directory.
