Nestopia is a portable Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. It strives for
the most accurate emulation possible at the pixel-by-pixel and sample-by-sample
level. It was also one of the inspirations for bsnes.

A 1Ghz CPU and 128MB RAM are required to get the best performance.

A Disk System BIOS (disksys.rom) is optional and, of course, not included. If
you have one, put it in ~/.nestopia

Note 1: parallel building is supported with a max of 2 jobs.

Note 2: To play NES games, consider using RetroArch with the Nestopia core
instead. SlackBuilds can be found here:
