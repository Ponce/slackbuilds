qtads (a multimedia interpreter for TADS games)

QTads is a so called "interpreter" for games created with the Text
Adventure Development System, or "Tads" for short, a C-like object
oriented programming language for authoring Interactive Fiction
(similar to the Infocom or Legend Entertainment games, like
"Zork"). Yes, we are talking about text adventures here.

Both Tads 2 (*.gam) as well as Tads 3 (*.t3) games
are supported. You can find a selection of games at
http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/

By default, Qt4 is used for the user interface. If you prefer Qt5,
install libraries/qt5 and run this script with QT5=yes in the
environment.
