# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

ufoai: UFO: Alien Invasion
ufoai:
ufoai: This is a squad based tactical strategy game, heavily inspired by the
ufoai: X-COM PC games, but with twist. Old veterans will appreciate how the
ufoai: game captures the spirit of the UFO: Enemy Unknown, the first one in
ufoai: the X-COM series. It tries to combine military realim with science
ufoai: fiction with the weirdness of an alien invasion. The game, however,
ufoai: is not a remake or a sequel.
ufoai: It runs on a modified Quake 2 game engine.
