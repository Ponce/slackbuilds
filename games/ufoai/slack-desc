ufoai: ufoai (UFO: Alien Invasion)
ufoai:
ufoai: This is a squad based tactical strategy game, heavily inspired by the
ufoai: X-COM PC games, but with twist. Old veterans will appreciate how the
ufoai: game captures the spirit of the UFO: Enemy Unknown, the first one in
ufoai: the X-COM series. It tries to combine military realism with science
ufoai: fiction with the weirdness of an alien invasion. The game, however,
ufoai: is not a remake or a sequel.
