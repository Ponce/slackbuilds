UFO: Alien Invasion

This is a squad based tactical strategy game, heavily inspired by the
X-COM PC games, but with twist. Old veterans will appreciate how the
game captures the spirit of the UFO: Enemy Unknown, the first one in
the X-COM series. It tries to combine military realism with science
fiction with the weirdness of an alien invasion. The game, however,
is not a remake or a sequel.

It runs on a modified Quake 2 game engine.

If you want to try out the game editor (uforadiant), install gtksourceview
before running this build.

If you're going to install the package on a host whose CPU lacks streaming
SIMD extensions, set SSE=no in the script's environment. To find out
whether SSE is supported, try "grep sse /proc/cpuinfo". If you get no
output, you don't have SSE.

By default, ufoai is built with SDL1. If you'd prefer SDL2, install
SDL2 and SDL2_ttf, then run this script with SDL2=yes in the environment.
