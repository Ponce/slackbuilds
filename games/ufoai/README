ufoai (UFO: Alien Invasion)

This is a squad based tactical strategy game, heavily inspired by the
X-COM PC games, but with twist. Old veterans will appreciate how the
game captures the spirit of the UFO: Enemy Unknown, the first one in
the X-COM series. It tries to combine military realism with science
fiction with the weirdness of an alien invasion. The game, however,
is not a remake or a sequel.

It runs on a modified Quake 2 game engine.

If you're going to install the package on a host whose CPU lacks
streaming SIMD extensions, set SSE=no in the script's environment. To
find out whether SSE is supported, try "grep sse /proc/cpuinfo". If
you get no output, you don't have SSE.

By default, ufoai is built with SDL2. If you'd prefer SDL1, run this
script with SDL2=no in the environment.

Optional *broken* stuff: The map editor for UFO:AI is called
uforadiant. It's disabled by default because it's broken: it
segfaults on startup on Slackware-current (October 2021) and the
SlackBuild maintainer hasn't figured out why, yet. If you want
to try uforadiant, install the optional dependencies gtkglext and
gtksourceview, then build with RADIANT=yes in the environment. If you
try this and uforadiant *doesn't* segfault for you, *please* contact
the maintainer!
