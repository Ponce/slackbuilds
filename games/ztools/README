ztools (tools for use with Infocom and other Z-Code story files)

infodump - data file dumper for infocom format game files
pix2gif - converts infocom MG1/EG1 picture files to separate GIF files
txd - Z code disassembler for Infocom game files
zcheck - integrity checker for infocom format story files
zcut - extract Infocom story files from disk images
zdebugtool - sneak into the depths of INFOCOM adventures
zrename - rename z-code story files according to their z-machine version

zcheck and zdebugtool have been renamed, as "check" and "debugtool" are
very generic names, likely to conflict with some other package.

zcut, zdebugtool, and zrename are normally distributed separately. They're
included in this build because they're too small to justify separate
builds, yet too useful for a Z-Code developer to do without.
