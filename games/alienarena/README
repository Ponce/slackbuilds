The goal of Alien Arena was to create the perfect marriage between Quake
and Unreal Tournament, between retro sci-fi and futuristic tech, and
between casual gamer and advanced expert, and wrap it up in a package with
quality that could rival that of commercial games. The game has a weapon
set that is unique and fun, and deviates a bit away from the standard Q3
or UT2k4 weapons. Gameplay can be altered easily in the menu by choosing
between the various game types, such as Deathmatch, Team Core Assault,
All Out Assault, Capture the Flag, Duel, and Cattle Prod. Users can also
apply a number of different mutators to the game rules as well, creating
some pretty interesting scenarios. Players can join others on servers
using the in-game browser, or use the Galaxy client, which also serves as
a way to communicate with the large, and friendly Alien Arena community.

Alienarena requires OpenAL.
