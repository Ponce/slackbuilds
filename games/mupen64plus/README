Mupen64Plus is a plugin-based N64 emulator for Linux which is capable
of accurately playing many games. Included are four MIPS R4300 CPU
emulators, with dynamic recompilers for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64
systems, and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP),
signal co-processor (RSP), and input.

Note: Mupen64plus will build against SDL2 if installed, but SDL2 is not required.

The 2.0 branch of mupen64plus does not include a GUI.  If you want
one install the m64py package.
