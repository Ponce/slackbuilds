Mupen64Plus is a plugin-based N64 emulator for Linux which is capable
of accurately playing many games. Included are four MIPS R4300 CPU
emulators, with dynamic recompilers for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64
systems, and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP),
signal co-processor (RSP), and input.

Mupen64plus does not come with a GUI.  For a GUI, install the m64py
package available here at SBo.
