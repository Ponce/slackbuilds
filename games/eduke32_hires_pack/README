eduke32_hires_pack (Duke3D High Resolution Pack)

The Duke3D High Resolution Pack allows you to use much better looking
textures than the original game (released back in 1996) had to offer
in the first place. It also introduces 3D model replacements for the
old enemies/weapons/items sprites. In combination with an OpenGL port
like JFDuke3D or EDuke32, this gives Duke Nukem 3D a modernized, more
appealing look and even motivates Duke veterans to play through the
original episodes once again.

You'll need a high-end video card to use this at a decent framerate.

The SC-55 Music Pack used to be optional; it's now always included.

This package is intended for use with the eduke32 package from
slackbuilds.org, but may also be used with other Duke3D source ports.

To enable the HRP in the eduke32 launcher:

- Enable the "Enable autoload folder" option.

- Select an OpenGL video mode.

- Enable the "Polymer" option.

- In the "Game" tab, make sure you're playing either Duke Nukem 3D
  Atomic Edition or Duke Nukem 3D Shareware.

- Click "Start".

If you don't see the launcher (if eduke32 goes straight to the game),
run "eduke32 -setup".

These instructions also work for rednukem (from the nblood package),
except that it requires symlinks to be created first:

  mkdir -p ~/.config/rednukem/autoload
  ln -s /usr/share/games/eduke32/autoload/* ~/.config/rednukem/autoload
