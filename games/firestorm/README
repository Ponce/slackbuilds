Firestorm Viewer is an alternative client program for SecondLife, a
virtual world developed by Linden Lab accessible via the internet.

Firestorm Viewer is based on Linden Lab's Viewer versions 2 and 3.
It has loads of new and innovative features added to improve
performance, increase usability, and generally enhance the user's
overall experience.

Firestorm Viewer is a 32 bit application and does not run on standard
64 bit systems.

NOTE: Linden Lab have stated they intend to begin rolling out Server 
Side Appearance (formerly known as Server Side Baking) on July 9th 
or shortly thereafter. It is of paramount importance that all 
Firestorm users upgrade to 4.4.1 before the 9th of July.

NOTE: the Phoenix Firestorm project require that you do a clean
install when upgrading to version 4.4.1 from a previous version. 
A detailed documention of the procedure is available at 
http://wiki.phoenixviewer.com/doku.php?id=fs_clean_reinstall .

NOTE: this SlackBuild is made for the Havok release of Firestorm.
Due to licensing reasons, this version can only be used for the
Second Life main grid and beta grid. If you want to connect to an
open sim you must use the Opensim release of Firestorm for which
a separate package is available. Both packages can be installed 
in parallel on the same Slackware installation.
