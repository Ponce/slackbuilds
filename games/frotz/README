frotz (Z-machine interpreter)

Frotz is an interpreter for Infocom games and other Z-machine games. It
complies with standard 1.0 of Graham Nelson's specification. Games can
be found at: http://www.ifarchive.org/

3 executables are always built:

* frotz - uses curses, no images, needs libmodplug for sound.
* sfrotz - SDL2 UI, supports images and sound, works great in X11,
           probably also Wayland (not tested by SlackBuild author).
* dfrotz - dumb terminal frotz, doesn't support images nor sound.

Optionally, you can set XFROTZ=yes to build:

* xfrotz - native X11 UI, supports images, no sound. Most users won't
           want this; sfrotz is a better choice on modern X11.

Optional dependency: libmodplug. If this is installed, the curses
build (frotz) will support sound.
