sms_sdl (Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator)

SMS Plus is Sega Master System and Game Gear emulator. Originally,
it was written to run under DOS. Since Charles Mac Donald released
his emulator under the GPL terms, this emulator has been ported to
different platforms.

Zipped ROM images are now supported. Only the first ROM image in the
.zip file will be used. Other files (.txt, etc) in the .zip file are
allowed and ignored.
