nevernoid - clone of the game "Arkanoid", with extra powerups.

Nevernoid is distributed as binary-only freeware; this SlackBuild
script simply packages the binary in a Slack-friendly way, including
a wrapper script to allow the game to work without being run from its
data directory.

Note: In the 32-bit build, the fullscreen option is visible in the
options menu, but it's non-functional (author disabled it on purpose). The
fullscreen option works in the 64-bit build.
