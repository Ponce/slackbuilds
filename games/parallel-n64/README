Parallel-n64 is a cross-platform plugin-based N64 emulator which is
capable of accurately playing many games.

This package was previously called mupen64plus-libretro.

Parallel-n64 optionally supports using OpenGL ES 2 instead of OpenGL
which will require support in the libretro frontend, video card and
driver. This can be done by building Mupen64Plus with:
  GLES=1 ./parallel-n64.SlackBuild

Vulkan can be used instead of OpenGL which will require support in the
libretro frontend, video card and driver.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./parallel-n64.SlackBuild
