Lutris is an open gaming platform for Linux. 

It helps you install and manage your games in a unified interface.

Our goal is to support every game which runs on Linux,
from native to Windows games (via Wine) to emulators and
browser games. The desktop application and the website
are libre software, your contributions are welcome!

allegro is an optional dependency for some of the runners.
