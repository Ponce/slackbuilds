gzdoom-legacy (OpenGL port of DOOM, older version)

Enhanced OpenGL port of the official DOOM source code that also supports
Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.

This is "gzdoom-legacy", which supports older versions of gzdoom that
run smoothly on older/slower hardware. If you're looking for the latest
version, you want the regular "gzdoom" build. Note that gzdoom-legacy
and gzdoom conflict: only install one or the other.

See README_SBo.txt for optional runtime dependencies.

This script can be used to build gzdoom 1.8.09, 1.9.1, or 2.3.2. For
more information, see README_versions.txt.

*Note: if you're upgrading from gzdoom-1.5.x to 1.9.x or 2.x, the
config file location has changed. To keep your old settings:

  mkdir -p ~/.config/gzdoom
  cp ~/.gzdoom/zdoom.ini ~/.config/gzdoom/gzdoom.ini

If you're upgrading from gzdoom 1.7 or 1.8:
  mv ~/.config/gzdoom/zdoom.ini ~/.config/gzdoom/gzdoom.ini
