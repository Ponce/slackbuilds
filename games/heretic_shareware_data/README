heretic_shareware_data (shareware Heretic game data)

Game data from the shareware release of Heretic (heretic1.wad, v1.2). 
Includes only the first episode of the game.

You'll need a Doom engine that's capable of playing Heretic to use
this. zdoom and gzdoom will work; prboom, prboom-plus, odamex, and
skulltag won't.
