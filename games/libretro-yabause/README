Yabause is a Sega Saturn video game system emulator that can be used as
a libretro core.

Yabause (Yet Another Buggy And Uncomplete Saturn Emulator) is the
only active Sega Saturn emulator that is both open-source and written
with portability in mind. The libretro port only supports the software
renderer at the moment, which is more accurate but also slower than the
GL renderer.

Yabause optionally supports usage of an actual Saturn BIOS image file
for increased compatibility:

* saturn_bios.bin

Any kind Saturn BIOS file should be good to go.

To build the debugging symbols use:
  DEBUG=1 ./libretro-yabause.SlackBuild
