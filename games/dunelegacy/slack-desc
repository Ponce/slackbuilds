# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dunelegacy: dunelegacy (real-time strategy game)
dunelegacy:
dunelegacy: Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize
dunelegacy: the first-ever real-time strategy game. The original game was the
dunelegacy: basis for the hugely successful Command and Conquer series, and
dunelegacy: the gameplay has been replicated and extended to a wide variety of
dunelegacy: storylines and series. Lead one of three interplanetary houses,
dunelegacy: Atreides, Harkonnen or Ordos, in an attempt to harvest the largest
dunelegacy: amount of spice from the sand dunes. Exchange your spice stockpiles
dunelegacy: for credits through refinement and build an army capable of thwarting
dunelegacy: attempts of the other houses to stop your harvesting!
