dunelegacy (real-time strategy game)

Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize the
first-ever real-time strategy game. The original game was the basis
for the hugely successful Command and Conquer series, and the gameplay
has been replicated and extended to a wide variety of storylines and
series.

Lead one of three interplanetary houses, Atreides, Harkonnen or Ordos,
in an attempt to harvest the largest amount of spice from the sand
dunes. Exchange your spice stockpiles for credits through refinement
and build an army capable of thwarting attempts of the other houses to
stop your harvesting!

Dune Legacy is a game engine only. To play the game, you must have
the data files (*.PAK) from the full version (not the demo) of the
original game, in /usr/share/dunelegacy. More info here:
