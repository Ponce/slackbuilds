Zelda Return of the Hylian Solarus Edition is a remake of the original Zelda
Return of the Hylian, a short and pleasant fangame from Vincent Jouillat. The
original game was developed in C++ and was released in 2006.

This new version was developed with the Solarus engine by Christopho, Mymy and
Vincent Jouillat. While this is essentially the same game, a lot of details were
improved thanks to the use of Solarus.
