micropolis: micropolis (GPL'd original SimCity game)

Micropolis is a simulation game based on the original source code of
SimCity, donated to the One Laptop Per Child project by Electronic
Arts under the GPL v3. Micropolis is developed by Don Hopkins, one of
the game's original authors.

NOTE: This SlackBuild is for a git snapshot dated 2010-04-18 obtained
from: http://git.zerfleddert.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/micropolis which
is a community-maintained version with several important patches and
bugfixes.

Additionally, please note that the first startup screen may be too
large for monitors with a lower resolution. Unfortunately, this is a
bug that has not been fixed yet. However, by using ALT-left mouse
button, one can move the startup screen around enough to see
everything. Once the game starts, the resolution should scale down
correctly to fit within your monitor.

Finally, the original source for the OLPC version of this game removed
the airplane crash disaster. This has been added back in to the
community-maintained version from which this package is built, and
this SlackBuild enables it by default. If you wish to disable the
airplane crash disaster, please see the SlackBuild, as there is a line
that can be commented out to disable it.
