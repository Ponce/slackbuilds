Our goal is to improve upon VisualBoyAdvance by integrating the best features
from the various builds floating around. Unfortunately work on the "official"
project seems to have stalled. Independent developers have added excellent
features to VBA, but seem to have done so individually. The source codes for
many of these forks seem to be abandoned, outdated or missing altogether.
We aim to preserve all of the hard work done by these developers to make the
already great VisualBoyAdvance even better!

The following options are available:
GTK=ON will build the GTK GUI. It requires gtkglextmm.
WX=ON will build the WxWidgets GUI. It requires WxWidgets.
FFMPEG=ON will enable recording and playback. It requires FFMPEG.
