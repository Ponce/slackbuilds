VisualBoyAdvance-M is a Nintendo Game Boy Emulator with high compatibility with
commercial games.

It emulates the Nintendo Game Boy Advance hand held console, in addition to the
original Game Boy hand held systems and its Super and Color variants.

VBA-M is a continued development of the now inactive VisualBoy Advance project,
with many improvements from various developments of VBA.

This application is the GTK GUI version of VisualBoyAdvance-M. The name of the
executable is "gvbam".

FFMPEG=ON will enable recording and playback. It requires FFMPEG.

There are a couple of alternatives you might try instead of this VBAM
SlackBuild.

The first is mGBA, which is available on SlackBuilds.org.

The second is RetroArch with the VBAM core. The SlackBuilds for that are
