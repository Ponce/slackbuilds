# 20211117 bkw: note to self: there's been recent activity in
# upstream's git. If another 6-12 months goes by without a release,
# consider updating this for the latest git.

# 20211117 bkw: BUILD=2
# - fix build for -current and recent wxGTK3 update.
# - relicense as WTFPL with permission from JK Wood.
# - old-style icon symlink.
# - call executable with full path in .desktop.
# - add missing changelog/readme/todo to docdir.
# - get rid of FFMPEG option (it's always enabled now).
# - disable checking for updates (there haven't been any in
#   5 years anyway, and this is a bit of a privacy concern for
#   some users).
# - make wxGTK3 optional.
# - only include .desktop and doinst in package if wxGTK3 enabled.
# - make SFML optional. it's actually autodetected in v2.1.4,
#   so all this means is removing it from REQUIRES and adding
#   a note to README.
# - always build the SDL UI executable (/usr/games/vbam).
# - include vbam.ini.sample in docdir.

# 20191129 bkw: updated for 2.1.4.
# 20180702 bkw: updated for 2.1.0.
# 20180612 bkw: updated for 2.0.2.
# 20171219 bkw: updated for 2.0.1.
# 20170302 bkw: use long-format github URL

# 20170126 bkw:
# - New maintainer, remove old maintainers' email addresses.
# - Update for 2.0.0beta3. This adds SDL2 and SFML as deps.
#   Actually I could make SFML optional, it's only used for emulating
#   the GBA link cable. If anyone *really* wants to do this, add
#   -DENABLE_LINK=OFF to the cmake command. Not going to add it as
#   an option unless someone requests it.
# - Install binary in /usr/games, not /usr/bin.
# - Use correct wx-config, even if /usr/bin/wx-config symlink points
#   to 2.8 instead of 3.0.
# - Get rid of Windows-only doc.
# - Binary & source name has changed to visualboyadvance-m, keep the
#   old vbam name as symlinks.
# - Correct README, plus cosmetic reformatting.
