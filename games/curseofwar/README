This is a fast-paced action strategy game for Linux implemented using
ncurses user interface. Unlike most RTS, you are not controlling units,
but focus on high-level strategic planning: Building infrastructure,
securing resources, and moving your armies.  The core game mechanics
turns out to be quite close to WWI-WWII type of warfare, however, there
is no explicit reference to any historical period.
