Wolfenstein Enemy Territory : Legacy is a project that aims
to create a fully compatible client and server for the popular
online FPS game Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

This script repackages the original ID assets for W:ET to use
with etlegacy (they are needed for the game to run): the
resulting package is not redistributable.
