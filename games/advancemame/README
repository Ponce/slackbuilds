advancemame (Multi Arcade Machine Emulator)

Advancemame is a derivative of the well known "mame" emulator.
It works easily on linux, with joystick support, fullscreen
support, and more "out of the box."

By default, advancemame is built with SDL2. If you want to build
advancemame with SDL-1.2, set SDL2=no in the script's environment.
