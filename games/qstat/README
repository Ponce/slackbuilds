QStat is a command-line program that displays information about Internet game servers.
The servers are either down, non-responsive, or running a game.
For servers running a game, the server name, map name, current number of players,
and response time are displayed. Server rules and player information may also be displayed.

A copy of the of the GitHub repo is hosted on my website, dated with the last commit date.
I only have mirrored it, removed the hidden git folder, and put it in a tarball. Nothing else was changed.
