nexuiz (open-source first person shooter game)

Nexuiz is a fast paced 3d deathmatch game project created online
by a team of developers called Alientrap. It is based on the
open-sourced Quake engine. Nexuiz is a standalone game that can
be played locally or over the internet. It is completely open
source.

Note: This SlackBuild just repackages the binaries (no compiling). The
