marathon-eternal-data (game data for use with alephone)

Eternal is a free scenario for Aleph One, the multi-platform,
open-source, first-person-shooter engine derived from Bungie's
Marathon engine. It continues the story of the Marathon trilogy,
and is a nearly total conversion, featuring:

  * Fifty-two new levels, some revisiting familiar locations from
    the original Marathon trilogy.  
  * Over six hundred fifty new high-resolution textures, including
    a dozen original landscape textures, from a variety of human
    and alien environments.
  * Eight all new weapons, many of which must be scavenged from your
    defeated enemies.
  * Over a dozen tracks of original music, including many remixes of
    your favorite tracks from the original Marathon.
  * And several new creatures and characters, alongside the complete
    cast from the original trilogy.

Included in the package is a shell script wrapper. Type "marathon-eternal"
or select Marathon Eternal X from the KDE or XFCE "Games" menu.

To install the gamedata in /opt instead of /usr to save space in the
root partition use use OPT=yes ./marathon-eternal-data.SlackBuild
