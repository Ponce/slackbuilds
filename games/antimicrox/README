AntiMicroX is a fork of AntiMicro, a GUI application to intercept
gamepad signals and translate them to keyboard and mouse events.
Use it so you can play games with a gamepad that have poor or no
native gamepad support.

It works for games you're playing on Linux or with WINE. It works with
Steam or stand-alone games. (Note that Steam does a pretty good job
of translating most controllers even for games without gamepad support,
so you may not need AntiMicroX).

Profiles
--------

Some pre-built game controller profiles are available here:

These allow you to download button mappings for popular games so that
you don't have to configure them yourself.
