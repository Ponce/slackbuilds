ds-models (3D model packs for skulltag)

ds-models allows Skulltag to play Doom, Heretic, and Hexen with OpenGL
and 3D models, which gives it a much more modern look.

This model set was released by -=Dark-Assassin=- on the SkullTag
forum.

As of r15, ds-models supports Zandronum, but there's no SlackBuild for
Zandronum yet, so no support for it here (yet).

This includes a script called "ds-skulltag" for starting skulltag with
the models preloaded.

To make skulltag always use the models, edit and/or
~/.skulltag/skulltag.ini and add the following lines under the
[Global.Autoload] marker:

Path=/usr/share/games/doom/GZ-Models.pk3
Path=/usr/share/games/doom/ST-Models.pk3

Note that the models will only be displayed if skulltag is using the
OpenGL renderer (Options | Display Options in the in-game menu).

Note: gzdoom doesn't display these models properly.
