Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game
with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers.
Exult is a project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems,
capable of using the data and graphics files that come with the game.

Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern
hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible.
You need to own "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" and/or "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle" and optionally the
add-ons (not required to run) in order to use Exult, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.

exult_audio.zip is only needed for using digital audio with exult, it can be skipped if digital
audio is not wanted.
