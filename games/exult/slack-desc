# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

exult: As computers evolve, we risk losing classic games from the not-so-
exult: distant past. One of these, Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's,
exult: still has a huge following, and many consider it to be one of the
exult: most immersive games ever produced. Exult is a project to recreate
exult: Ultima 7 for modern operating systems, using the game's original
exult: plot, data, and graphics files.
