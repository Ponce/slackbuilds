nuvie (New Ultima VI Engine)

Nuvie, pronounced 'New-Vee' is an open sourced game engine for playing Origin's games
Ultima 6, Martian Dreams and Savage Empire on modern operating systems. Ultima 6 is
fully playable from start to finish with Nuvie. Nuvie also contains many enhancements
to the original game engine including new UI modes, featuring drag'n'drop and full map
view mode. Alternate graphics are also supported.

The game data required for using nuvie is not included and must be acquired separately.
The data directory from an Ultima collection CD is enough. The game data's location has
to be specified in /usr/share/nuvie/nuvie.cfg or in $HOME/.nuvierc.
