gtkballs (clone of Lines - logic game about balls)

GtkBalls is a clone of the well-known MS-DOS game "Lines".

See the man page or press F1 in the game, to see the rules.

The game is installed setgid games, to be able to write to its high
score file. If this bothers you, 'export SETGID=no' in the script
environment; the game won't be able to save high scores in that case.
