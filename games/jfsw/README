jfsw (source port of Shadow Warrior first-person shooter game)

The aim of this port is to present Shadow Warrior as closely as possible
to the original game while adding optional features to expand the
possibilities of the game.

To play the game, you will need the sw.grp data file from either the
full or shareware DOS version of Shadow Warrior. If you want to play the
shareware version, you can install jfsw_demo_data from slackbuilds.org.
For the full version, copy sw.grp from the game directory to
/usr/share/games/jfsw/sw.grp (the filename must be lowercase).

If you have sw.grp from the full version of the game, you may also want
to install jfsw_hires_pack for some graphic enhancements (don't bother
trying if all you have is the shareware sw.grp: it segfaults on startup).

Note #1: If you run into an issue turning left or right with the mouse,
edit the config file (~/.jfsw/sw.cfg) and change MouseAnalogAxes0 to
"analog_turning" and MouseAnalogAxes1 to "analog_moving". The digital
axes should have "" values.
