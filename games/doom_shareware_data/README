doom_shareware_data (game data from the shareware Doom release)

Game data from the shareware release of Doom (doom1.wad, v1.9). Includes
only the first episode of the game.

You'll need a Doom engine to use this. Currently slackbuilds.org
offers zdoom, prboom, prboom-plus, odamex, chocolate-doom, skulltag,
and probably a few more.
