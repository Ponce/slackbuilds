pinball (open source pinball simulator)

The Emilia Pinball project is an open source pinball simulator
intended for Linux machines, by Henrik Enqvist.

Note: when you first run the game, use "Load Table" before trying to
start the game (otherwise you get a "No table loaded" error).

Note: slibtool users should use 'clibtool-shared' with pinball which
will install the libtool archive (.la) files. Pinball will fail to
load any tables when they are missing. If you don't know what slibtool
is, you can safely ignore this paragraph.
