img2xterm (display images on the terminal)

img2xterm is a program that can display bitmap images on 256-colour
terminals by converting them into Unicode block characters and xterm
compatible control sequences. It can also convert images to cowfiles,
for use with cowsay(6).

No checking is done on the terminal size. Each character cell in the
terminal gets a 2x2 block of pixels, so if your terminal is 80x25, the
largest image it can display is 160x50 pixels.

This is known to work with xterm, konsole, and xfce4-terminal
from Slackware 14.2; and rxvt-unicode (urxvt) and st from
SlackBuilds.org. Plain rxvt doesn't seem to support 256-color mode,
so it won't work there. Sadly, it doesn't work in the Linux console
either.

The package includes the GIMP palette mentioned in the README.md, and
an RMS cowfile. Try: cowsay -f rmshd "Hello"
