wolf4sdl (Wolfenstein 3D engine)

Wolf4SDL is an open-source SDL port of id Software's classic
first-person shooter Wolfenstein 3D. It is meant to keep the original
feel while taking advantage of some modern improvements.

This build includes the game data files from the shareware/demo versions
of Wolfenstein 3D and its sequel Spear of Destiny.

To play the full versions of the games, you need the *.wl*, *.sod,
and/or *.sd* files from your installed copies of the games. Copy them to
"/usr/share/games/wolf3d". Filenames must be all-lowercase.
