zseal
open source client for FICS Timeseal v2 for Linux/Unix systems

Timeseal is a protocol for network lag reporting and compensation used by the FICS chess
server (freechess.org).  Version 2 of the protocol provides better delay stats as the server
actively pings the client periodically.  FICS's FTP repository was taken down a few years
ago and was never put back on.
Since then, there has been nowhere to download a trustable timeseal client for Linux systems.


To use with xboard, append "-icshelper zseal" to your normal xboard command line.

  xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org -icsport 5000 -icshelper zseal


Assuming Slackware's gnuchess package is already installed on your system,
the install script will integrate and enable zseal in eboard automatically.
(Otherwise, follow the instructions for eboard configuration in /usr/doc/zseal-1.0/README.)
