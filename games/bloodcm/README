bloodcm (first-person shooter game)

Blood Crossmatching (formerly known as BloodTC) is a recreation of Blood
(by Monolith Productions) for EDuke32 to bring all the fun and action of
Blood to the EDuke32 port. This mod will be more powerful in the future,
considering EDuke32 keeps getting better and better.

No data files from the original game are required.

eduke32 will need to be at least version 20160704_5811 for this to work.

To play BloodCM: Launch EDuke32, select BloodCM in the "Custom Game"
drop-down list, click "Start".
