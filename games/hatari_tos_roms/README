hatari_tos_roms (TOS ROM images for Atari ST emulators)

TOS (Tramiel Operating System) ROM images for use with hatari or other
ST emulators. US and UK versions 1.02, 1.04, and 2.06 included.

These images are copyrighted by Atari, Inc. It may be illegal to install
this package in your jurisdiction! On the other hand, they're freely
available on various web sites, and have been for many years with no
legal action taken.

The hatari emulator will use /usr/share/hatari/tos.img by default. This
package creates a symlink from tos-1.02-uk.img to tos.img, so the
emulator will use this ROM image. To use a different ROM, either change
the symlink or give the ROM image location on the hatari command line.
