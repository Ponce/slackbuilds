ace (a set of Unix/X solitaire games)

The Ace of Penguins is a set of Unix/X solitaire games based on the
ones available for Windows(tm) but with a number of enhancements.

The latest version includes clones of freecell, golf, mastermind,
merlin, minesweeper, pegged, solitaire, taipei (with editor) and
thornq.

The executables are installed with -ace suffix, e.g. solitaire-ace.
This is to avoid conflicting with Slackware's bsd-games and xgames
packages.

While any of the games are running, press H for help, or Q to exit.
