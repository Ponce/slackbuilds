Blake Stone: Planet Strike Source Code Release - July 5, 2013.

Please note that this is being released without any kind of
support from the original developers of this game or Apogee Software,
LLC, Apogee Software, Ltd / 3DRealms Entertainment.  

We are releasing this code for the entertainment of the user
community. This is all the source we have relating to Blake Stone:
Planet Strike.  We haven't looked at this stuff in years, and
make no guarantee that you will be able to get it to work, nor do we
guarantee that it won't blow up your computer if you do try and use
it. ;)

You will need the data from a released version of Blake Stone: Planet
Strike to use the .exe built from this code. We cannot and will not
help in getting this running.

Caveat Emptor - Use at your own risk.

Please note that while we are releasing the source code to Blake
Stone: Planet Strike, the game itself has not been released in the
same manner (in other words, Blake Stone: Planet Strike is still
commercial software). You can still buy the game from us by visiting
the Apogee Software online store at:

...or GOG.com at:

Thanks to all the fans who have enjoyed the game and to those that
have contacted us about the possibility of releasing this source. If
