This is an improved version of Warzone 2100, a 3D science fiction 
real time strategy game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published 
by Eidos Interactive in 1999. 

Warzone 2100 offers campaign, tutorial, multi-player and single-player 
skirmish game modes, unit designer, unit experience system, and everything 
you would expect from a modern RTS game.

The 3.1 series does not transfer the 2.3 series saved games.

If you wish to include the animated movies, read the README.movies file.

GLee is an optional dependency.
