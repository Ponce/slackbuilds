Run id Software's legendary Quake inside a dockapp! Play full on software Quake, mods, or
let it play demos. Fixed by Eukos for newer systems.

Notes: 

Be sure to start it with -nosound other wise it will segfault!

Sound will not work because it uses a very old method. It MAY work on a system with
OSS3 installed. The OSS version on SBo (OSS4) will NOT work with this game and neither
will aoss for ALSA users.

This SlackBuild moves the executable into, "/usr/share/games/quake/wmquake". This is to allow
other Quake engines to be placed in here, for example: "/usr/share/games/quake/darkplaces".

Your id1 folder (and mods) must go into, "/usr/share/games/quake/wmquake", for there is no home
folder for data. You should have permissions to modify this folder with the games group.
