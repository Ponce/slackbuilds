SYNOPSIS
========

commandergenius [*dir=dir*] [*finale=<on|off>*]

CGeniusExe [*dir=dir*] [*finale=<on|off>*] [*level=level*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Commander Genius is an open-source clone of Commander Keen which allows
you to play the games, and some of the mods made for it. All of the
original data files are required to do so, however the authors have
provided convenient way to download some of the games (choose "Game
Center" at the main menu). It's also possible to use the data files from
an installed copy of one or more of the games.

Supported games are Keen 1 through 6, plus Keen Dreams and several
fan-made mods.

This man page is a brief summary. Full documentation can be found
in:

/usr/doc/commandergenius-|version|/README.md
