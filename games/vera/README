vera (acronym dictionary)

V.E.R.A. is a free list of acronyms all of which are used in the field
of computing. It is released under the GNU Free Documentation License.

The dictionary is installed in 3 formats:

- GNU Info format. Use "info vera" to access.
- The wtf(6) database. Use "wtf <acronym>" to access. This replaces
  the tiny/outdated acronym list from bsd-games.
- HTML. Point your browser at file:///usr/doc/vera-1.24/vera.html
  to access.

If you remove this package, reinstall bsd-games to revert to the
original wtf database.
