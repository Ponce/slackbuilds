The Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the 3DO version of the PC game "Star
Control II". It runs on modern operating systems and is 100% free.

This package contains optional game content that provides high-quality
in-game music. You don't need this package to play the game. Without
this package, there will still be music during the game; it just doesn't
sound as nice.
