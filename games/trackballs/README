Trackballs is a marble game inspired by the 80s Atari classic Marble
Madness.

By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth filled with sharp objects,
pools of acid, and other obstacles, the player collects points. When
the destination is reached you continue on to the next, more difficult
level... unless the time runs out.

This Slackware package can include the music and/or extra levels available
at http://trackballs.sourceforge.net

To add the music, download the file "trackballs-music-1.4.tar.bz2"
and save it in the same directory as the SlackBuild script. If using
a newer version of the music than 1.4, set MUSICVER in the environment
before running trackballs.SlackBuild.

To add extra levels, download the level collections you want and place
them in the levels/ subdirectory before running trackballs.SlackBuild. The
script can handle levels in tar or zip format. Note that some of the
add-on levels offered on the web site are now included with the game
source (specificallly, "Box O' Fun", "Child of Tales", and "Castles"
are part of the main game now, and don't need to be added). Also note
that the "Six Levels" pack doesn't work with this version of the game.
