FreeSerf is an open source recreation of The Settlers 1 (Serf City).
You need the original game assets though to play the game.

Copy the original data file(s) of The Settlers 1 to
~/.local/share/freeserf. The DOS data file is called SPA?.PA (case
sensitive!), while the Amiga files are called gfx*, sounds and music.
