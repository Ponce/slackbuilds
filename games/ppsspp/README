PPSSPP can run your PSP games on your PC in full HD resolution. It can
even upscale textures that would otherwise be too blurry as they were
made for the small screen of the original PSP.

* Play in HD resolutions and more * Play on a tablet for big-screen
mobile gaming * Customize on-screen touch controls or use an external
controller or keyboard * Save and restore game state anywhere, anytime
* Crank up the anisotropic filtering and texture scaling * Continue
where you left off by transferring saves from your real PSP

snappy is an optional dependency.

QT=on will enable QT GUI and require qt5 installed (default is
'QT=off').
