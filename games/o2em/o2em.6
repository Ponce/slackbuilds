.SH FILES
.TP
\fB/usr/games/o2em\fR
Shell script wrapper. Sets up ~/.o2em if needed, runs the actual
binary. This is required because o2em was ported from DOS, and
expects to be run in its own directory; with the wrapper, it
behaves like a proper UNIX program (run anywhere, writes only
to ~/.o2em).
.TP
\fB/usr/libexec/o2em.bin\fR
The actual o2em binary. Normally, you don't want to run this
directly (let the wrapper run it for you).
.TP
\fB/usr/share/games/o2em/bios\fR
BIOS ROM images. At minimum, \fBo2rom.bin\fR must exist. To use the
\fB\-c52\fR,
\fB\-jopac\fR, or
\fB\-g7400\fR
options, the appropriate BIOS image must be located here (see below).
The emulator checks the CRC of the ROM images,
and will refuse to start with an image it doesn't recognize. The correct
files are:
.PP
c52.bin (md5sum f1071cdb0b6b10dde94d3bc8a6146387)
.br
g7400.bin (md5sum c500ff71236068e0dc0d0603d265ae76)
.br
jopac.bin (md5sum 279008e4a0db2dc5f1c048853b033828)
.br
o2rom.bin (md5sum 562d5ebf9e030a40d6fabfc2f33139fd)
.PP
These are the same files used by MESS, except o2rom.bin is called
o2bios.rom by MESS.
.TP
\fB/usr/share/games/o2em/voice\fR
Voice samples, used to emulate the Odyssey2's speech synthesis chip.
.TP
\fB~/.o2em/\fR
Working directory for o2em. Will be created by shell script wrapper
the first time it's run. All save\-state and screenshot files will be
written here. The BIOS image, cartridge images, and voice samples will
be symlinked into this directory by the wrapper script.
.TP
\fB~/.o2em/o2em_def.cfg\fR
Config file (optional). See o2em.txt for details.
.TP
\fB/usr/doc/o2em\-\fR\fI$VERSION\fR\fB/o2em.txt\fR
Full documentation for o2em.
.SH AUTHORS
