o2em (Magnavox Odyssey II/VideoPac+ emulator)

o2em is an emulator for the Magnavox Odyssey II and VideoPac+ systems.

The Odyssey2 BIOS ROM image is required for emulation. To include it in
the package, get either the odyssey2.zip used with MESS, or else the ROM
image itself, called either o2rom.bin or o2bios.rom, and place it in the
build directory before running the SlackBuild. The ROM will be installed
in /usr/share/o2em/bios/o2rom.bin; if you build the package without the
ROM, just place a copy of the ROM there after installing the package.

Note to desktop users: o2em is a command-line X program and must be
run from an X terminal. It won't appear in your applications menu.
