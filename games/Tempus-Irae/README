Tempus-Irae (game data for use with alephone package)

Tempus Irae, a new scenario in the Marathon universe built upon
the Marathon Infinity engine. In Tempus Irae the player travels
back in time... to Renaissance Italy.

Tempus Irae combines over twenty-two thousand polygons of solo
maps with literally hundreds of new textures. New sounds, scenery
items, and shapes are combined with gorgeous terminal pictures and
chapter screens, as well as a first-rate script.

The Aleph One version of Tempus Irae includes both Tempus Irae and
Tempus Irae 2: The Lost Levelsi.

Included in the package is a shell script wrapper. Type "tempus-irae"
or select Tempus Irae from the KDE or XFCE "Games" menu. 

To install the gamedata in /opt instead of /usr to save space in the 
root partition use use OPT=yes ./Tempus-Irae.SlackBuild
