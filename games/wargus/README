wargus (Warcraft II data game set for the Stratagus engine)

Wargus can be used to play Warcraft II from Blizzard Entertainment.

You need the original Warcraft II for DOS or the Beyond the Dark
Portal expansion pack to extract the game data files. See the file
README_Slackware.txt for full instructions. If you don't read the
instructions, you won't get a playable game.

Upgrade note: dependencies have changed. Read wargus.info and
README_Slackware.txt even if you don't think you need to!
