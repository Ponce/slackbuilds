wargus (Warcraft II data game set for the Stratagus engine)

Wargus can be used to play Warcraft II from Blizzard Entertainment.

You need the original Warcraft II for DOS or the Beyond the Dark
Portal expansion pack to extract the game data files. See the
file README_SBo.txt for full instructions. If you don't read the
instructions, you won't get a playable game.

Note: I am aware that this is not the latest version of wargus.
However, it's the latest version I was able to actually play Warcraft
II with, using either the MS-DOS original or expansion CDs. Later
versions complain that the game data is missing/corrupt, right after
extraction. At some point I will try to find out what the issue is.
