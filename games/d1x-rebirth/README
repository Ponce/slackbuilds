d1x-rebirth is a source port of the Descent 1 Engine for Windows,
Mac OS and Linux offering OpenGL graphics and effects, advanced 
Multiplayer gaming, many improvements and new features.

You will need the game data files to actually use d1x-rebirth, 
place these in /usr/share/games/d1x-rebirth or ~/.d1x-rebirth. 
Details of how to extract the correct game files are found in 
the file INSTALL.txt. For enhanced gameplay I would suggest that
you consider downloading both the Highres 'AddOn pack' and improved 
soundtrack 'AddOn pack' from the dxx-rebirth site.

d1x-rebirth requires scons and physfs, both available on SBo.
