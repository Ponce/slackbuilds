an (Anagram Generator)

Generates anagrams for a phrase supplied by the user. The words used in
the anagram are taken from a specified dictionary which should contain
one word per line (default: /usr/share/dict/words).

On Slackware, /usr/share/dict/words comes from bsd-games, in y/ on the
install media.

an is a command-line program. If you'd like a GUI frontend also:

- Install the perl-tk package from slackbuilds.org
- Download anaffront.pl from http://fatphil.org/words/anaffront.pl and
  place it in the directory with the SlackBuild script
- Run the SlackBuild. anaffront will be part of the resulting package,
  including an entry in KDE's K menu.
- See the author's site at http://fatphil.org/words/an.html for more
  information about anaffront.
