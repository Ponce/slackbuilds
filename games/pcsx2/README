pcsx2 (PlayStation 2 emulator)

PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator.

Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of
MIPS CPU Interpreters, Recompilers and a Virtual Machine which manages
hardware states and PS2 system memory.

PCSX2 requires a CPU that supports the SSE4.1 instruction set.

Check your processor flags with lscpu for sse4_1.

PCSX2 requires a GPU that supports OpenGL 3.3 or Vulkan 1.1.

LLVM_OPT: llvm-opt is enabled by default, since upstream only supports
clang. If you already installed llvm >=17 from extra or used llvm in
current branch, LLVM_OPT could be disabled with LLVM_OPT=OFF.
