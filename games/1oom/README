1oom is an open source recreation of the Master of Orion 1 game engine.
You need the original game assets though to play the game. (available on
https://www.gog.com)

After buying the GOG version of Master of Orion 1, you can play 1oom
with the following steps:

$ mkdir ~/.1oom
$ cd ~/.1oom
$ innoextract /path/to/setup_master_of_orion_*.exe
$ 1oom -data ~/.1oom

On subsequent runs ``1oom'' is sufficient.

1oom optionally uses allegro4 (default is sdl2)
