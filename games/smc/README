smc (Secret Maryo Chronicles)

Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform
game with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such
as Super Mario Bros. It uses the platform independent library SDL and,
since version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated graphics renderer from
CEGUI. The game is developed in C++.

Notes:

The default keyboard controls are arrows to move, A to run, S to jump,
and Enter to use an item or (in the Overworld) start a level. See
/usr/doc/smc-$VERSION/controls.html and the in-game Options ->
Keyboard menu for more information.

To compile this game you will need CEGUI0.7. Make sure CEGUI0.7 is
compiled after FreeImage, as this needs a CEGUI0.7 with FreeImage
support built in (the latest CEGUI0.7 SlackBuild will automatically
use FreeImage if available).

Unfortunately, as of this writing, it's impossible to install both
CEGUI and CEGUI0.7 at the same time, so make sure CEGUI (the 0.8
version) isn't installed or you'll end up with a mess.
