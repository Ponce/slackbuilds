smc (Secret Maryo Chronicles)

Secret Maryo Chronicles is an Open Source two-dimensional platform game
with a style designed similar to classic sidescroller games such as
Super Mario Bros. It uses the platform independent library SDL and, since
version 0.98, the OpenGL accelerated graphics renderer from CEGUI. The
game is developed in C++.

Notes:

The default keyboard controls are arrows to move, A to run, S to jump,
and Enter to use an item or (in the Overworld) start a level. See
/usr/doc/smc-$VERSION/controls.html and the in-game Options -> Keyboard
menu for more information.

To compile this game you will need CEGUI0.7. Make sure CEGUI0.7 is
compiled after FreeImage, as this needs a CEGUI0.7 with FreeImage support
built in (the latest CEGUI0.7 SlackBuild will automatically use FreeImage
if available).

Unfortunately, as of this writing, it's impossible to install both CEGUI
and CEGUI0.7 at the same time, so make sure CEGUI (the 0.8 version)
isn't installed or you'll end up with a mess.
