maelstrom (Enhanced Asteroids-like game)

Maelstrom is a game similar to Asteroids.

You pilot your ship through the dreaded "Maelstrom" asteroid belt --
suddenly your best friend thrusts towards you and fires, directly
at your cockpit. You raise your shields just in time, and the battle
is joined. The deadliest stretch of space known to mankind has just
gotten deadlier.

This package also comes with a script to create Slackware
packages from the Maelstrom add-on graphics/sound files. Run
'maelstrom_addon_package.pl --help' for more information.
