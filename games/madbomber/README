Mad Bomber is a clone of the excellent 1981 Atari 2600 video game
"Kaboom!" by Larry Kaplan of Activision.

The Mad Bomber is loose in the city and he's dropping bombs
everywhere! It's your job to catch them before they hit the ground
and explode. Luckily, you have a set of trusty buckets to extinguish
them with.
