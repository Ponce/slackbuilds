ToME-SX (short for "Sexy Edition") is a variant of the roguelike game
ToME, based on version 2.3.5. The scope of this project is to add
variety to the game, change some parts that (according to my personal
opinion) need changing, and provide other people who are interested in
the variant with the possibility of playing and enjoying it too. Have
fun!

You can install ToME-SX alongside other ToME 2 forks, but must back up,
delete or save the save folder (~/.tome) between different games.
