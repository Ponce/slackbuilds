# Slackware build script for mame

# Written by B. Watson (urchlay@slackware.uk)

# Adapted from Erik W. Hanson's mame.SlackBuild for older mame versions,
# which was originally adapted from sdlmame.SlackBuild by B. Watson.

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# 20251203 bkw: Updated for v0.283 (incl. groovy patch).
# 20251111 bkw: Added groovy patch for v0.282, no other changes.
# 20251103 bkw: Updated for v0.282. No groovy yet.
# 20251008 bkw: Updated for v0.281, groovy patches have resumed!
# 20250902 bkw: Updated for v0.280. Still no groovy patch.
# 20250811 bkw: Updated for v0.279. No groovy patch this time, the
#   groovymame developer hasn't released one since May (for 0.277).
# - Only use ld.gold if it's installed (fixes -current build).
# - Upstream added pipewire support, but 15.0's pipewire is too old,
#   only try to build it if pipewire is >= v1.2.x.

# 20250515 bkw: Updated for v0.277 (incl. groovy patch).
# 20250405 bkw: Updated for v0.276 (incl. groovy patch).
# 20250304 bkw: Updated for v0.275 (incl. groovy patch).

# 20241216 bkw: Updated for v0.272 (incl. groovy patch).
# 20241101 bkw: Updated for v0.271 (incl. groovy patch).
# 20241009 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.270 (incl. groovy patch).

# OK, building modern mame is a bit of a PITA. It uses genie (written
# in lua, a fork of premake), but you don't get to run genie directly,
# you got a main makefile that builds lua, then builds genie,
# then runs genie with arguments based on the options in the main
# makefile... and genie generates a bunch of makefiles, then runs make
# on those. Also, it uses python3 to convert XML layout files to
# C++ code.

# During the Slackware 14.2 cycle, I used to do this:
# LDOPTS="-fuse-ld=gold -static-libstdc++ -static-libgcc" \
# This allowed installing Pat's unsupported gcc9 package,
# building mame with it, then restoring the original gcc
# version and mame would still run.

# Where possible, use system libraries instead of building the ones
# bundled with the mame source. However, SBo's lua is (still!) too old
# for mame.

# the bundled versions are fine and I don't want a mile-long dependency
