# Slackware build script for mame

# 20170404 bkw:
# - mame.ini: get rid of $HOME in bgfx_path. Thanks to Doogster for
# reporting this.

# 20170330 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.184.

# 20170301 bkw:
# - Use long-form github URL.
# - Fix changelog so newer entries are at the top.

# 20170223 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.183.

# 20170214 bkw:
# - Add support for GroovyMAME patch.

# 20170128 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.182.

# 20170111 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.181. Missed a month again.

# 20161101 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.179.

# 20160928 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.178. Sorry, missed a month.
# - Install artwork/ and bgfx/ so the new bgfx shader stuff will work.
# - Set bgfx_path in mame.ini. The default is still 'video opengl' but
#   now it's easy to enable bgfx, just by changing to 'video bgfx'.
#   Thanks to Doogster for pointing this out.

# 20160728 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.176. Upstream does a release on the last Wednesday
#   of every month. I doubt I'm going to find time to update this
#   script 12 times a year, but maybe...

# 20160721 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.175 (again, after missing several releases)
# - Update ARCH stuff, i486 => i586
# - Add missing mame.6 and mess.6 man pages (whoops!)
# - man pages now in docs/man/ instead of src/osd/sdl/
# - Don't modify the *.1 man pages to put them in section 6 any more
# - Symlink mame -> mess in /usr/games (to keep old frontends working)
# - Disable QT debugger by default, as it now requires qt5 and I don't
#   want qt5 as a hard dep for this... how many people who install mame
#   are *really* going to debug the game ROM code?
# - Add QTDEBUG=yes option for people who really want the debugger,
#   make slack-desc say whether or not it's enabled.
# - Upstream removed 'testkeys', stop trying to install it.

# 20151112 bkw:
# - Updated for v0.167, after missing several releases (sorry!)
# - Get rid of MESS and UME options, mame has basically turned
#   into UME at this point (includes old mame + mess in one binary)
# - Use shipped man pages from the source, instead of our own
# - Add new tools: castool floptool imgtool nlwav
# - Use icon extracted from mame.ico in the source
# - Update .ini file slightly (sound=sdl, not sound=1)

# OK, building modern mame is a bit of a PITA. It uses genie (written
# in lua, a fork of premake), but you don't get to run genie directly,
# you got a main makefile that builds lua, then builds genie, then runs
# genie with arguments based on the options in the main makefile. Also,
# it uses python to convert XML layout files to C++ code.

# Where possible, use system libraries instead of building the ones
# bundled with the mame source. However, SBo's lua is (still!) too old
# for mame.

# Upstream dropped sqlite as a dependency, this no longer matters.
#USE_SYSTEM_LIB_SQLITE3=1 \

# Not going to USE_SYSTEM_LIB_PORTAUDIO or USE_SYSTEM_LIB_PORTMIDI,
# the bundled versions are fine and I don't want a mile-long dependency
# tree. Using an external portmidi dep would make mame require Oracle's
# JDK! In case you're wondering, only the C code in the bundled portmidi
# is built (no Java needed).

# The OVERRIDE_CC and OVERRIDE_CXX are there because mame's build
# ignores $PATH when searching for gcc/g++, and won't find my ccache
# symlinks in /usr/local/bin. On a normal (non-ccache-using) system,
# these options do nothing (they use the compilers in /usr/bin, which
# is the default anyway) and you can forget about them... or, if you use
# distcc, this will allow it to actually work. (Mini-rant: PATH has been
# a standard mechanism on both Unix and DOS/Windows systems for what,
# 30 or 40 years now? Come on people...)

# This is purely cosmetic, and can't be set on the make command line.
