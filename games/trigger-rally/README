Trigger is a free 3D rally car racing game. Fun for all the family. Trigger
comes with a number of challenges where you have to race several tracks to
finish each challenge. When racing a track, you have to reach several locations
marked by pulsating rings in sequence. You win a race if you reach the last
location in time. Trigger is highly customisable, and it's easy to add new
levels and vehicles.
