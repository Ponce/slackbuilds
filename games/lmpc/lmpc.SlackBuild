# 20211022 bkw: BUILD=2
# - fix -current build (udemy.h)
# - get rid of PDF docs. Sorry, but I don't love tex enough to debug
#   whatever's broken them on -current. Read the HTML docs instead.
# - remove useless INSTALL from docdir.
# - rearrange docs slightly, simplify copying them.

# 20200416 bkw:
# - take over maintenance
# - TODO: find out what repo "1b70022" came from. It's newer than
#   than the version 3.4.4 at the homepage, maybe there's even newer
#   bugfix stuff?
# - i486 => i586
# - add -j1 to make command :(
# - binaries in /usr/games
