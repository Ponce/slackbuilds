LMPC is a utility to handle: DOOM, DOOM 2, Heretic, Hexen and Strife LMP files;
Duke Nukem 3D and Redneck Rampage DMO files; Quake DEM QuakeWorld QWD files;
and Quake II Arena DM3 files. The DEM file cutter tool (DEMcut), The DEM Text
File Analyser (DEMA), the Broadcasting Server (DBS) and the DM2 file
concatenator (DM2cat) are part of this package too.

Building this requires TeTex or TexLive to be installed, and
/usr/share/texmf/bin to be in your PATH. On a stock install, simply enter a
real root shell ("su -") before building.
