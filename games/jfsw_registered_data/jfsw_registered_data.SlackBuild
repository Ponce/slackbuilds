# Slackware build script for jfsw_registered_data

# Written by B. Watson (yalhcru@gmail.com)

# Licensed under the WTFPL. See http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/ for details.

# This game is offered as a free download on both Steam and GoG. It also
# was available from www.oldpcgaming.net from 2014 to late 2019, and
# has been available on archive.org since late 2018.

# 20211031 bkw: BUILD=3
# - use iso-read to extract files from the iso, rather than loop-mounting.
# - CREDITS.TXT => credits.txt.
# - add OGGQUAL option.

# 20200428 bkw: the old .7z from oldpcgaming.net has vanished along
# with the site. Switched to a CD image from archive.org, in bin/cue
# format. More work for this script to do, but as a nice bonus, we get
# the CD audio tracks installed too.
