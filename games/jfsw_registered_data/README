jfsw_registered_data (game data from full version of Shadow Warrior)

This is the full/registered version of Shadow Warrior, for use with the
jfsw game engine. The package includes the resource file (sw.grp) and
the audio tracks from the original CD, converted to .ogg for use with
the jfsw engine.

Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D
Realms and published by GT Interactive Software. The shareware version
was released for the PC on May 13, 1997, while the full version was
released on August 31, 1997. Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken
Silverman's Build engine.

The jfsw launcher supports both the demo version (jfsw_demo_data)
and the full version (jfsw_registered_data). Since the full version
includes the levels from the demo version (as Episode 1), there's no
need to install both on the same system, although this is supported.

While the package is being built, up to 1GB of space in /tmp (or $TMP)
will be used.
