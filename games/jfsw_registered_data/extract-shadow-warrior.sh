# Licensed under the WTFPL: Do WTF you want with this. See

# This file is part of the SlackBuilds.org jfsw_registered_data build,
# but you're welcome to use it for any other purpose (that's why I made
# it a standalone script).

# Extracts the game data from bin/cue of Shadow Warrior for DOS, as found
# in the zip file from https://archive.org/details/ShadowWarriorUSA. The
# tool that handles bin/cue files is bchunk, but sadly it doesn't properly
# handle bin/cue where each track is in a separate bin file... so we
# help it along by chopping up the .cue file.

# We expect a single argument: the name of the .cue file. Output will be
# a set of .iso and .wav files in the current directory, named track01.iso
# and track02.wav through track14.wav, plus a set of converted track02.ogg
# through track14.ogg, if the oggenc command is found on $PATH.

# When we're finished, the files will take up around 900MB of space,
# so plan accordingly.

# Note: converting the same wav file to ogg with oggenc multiple times,
# does not give identical ogg files. It *does* however give the same
# sized file every time (down to the byte). Really only matters if you're
# debugging this script, I guess.
