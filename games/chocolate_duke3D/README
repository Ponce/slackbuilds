chocolate_duke3D (Faithful Duke Nukem 3D port)

Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D is the equivalent of Chocolate Doom.

A port that:

 1. Remains as faithful as possible to the original source code.
 2. Is portable and compiles in one click on Windows, OS X and Linux.
 3. Is aimed at education, with lots of comments and documentation added
    in order to help programmers to understand and learn.

Note: Place "duke3d.grp" from any legit Duke 3D copy in
/usr/share/games/duke3d to play.

Currently, only 32-bit x86 is supported. The code is not 64-bit clean,
so it won't run correctly on x86_64.
