Chocolate Duke Nukem 3D is the equivalent of Chocolate Doom.

A port that:

 1. Remains as faithful as possible to the original source code.
 2. Portable and compiling in one click on Windows, OS X and Linux.
 3. Aimed at education, with lots of comments and documentation added in order to help programmers 
    to understand and learn.

Note: Place "duke3d.grp" from any legit Duke 3D copy to /usr/share/games/duke3d to play.
