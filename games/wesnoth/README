If you want to compile the wesnothd server and campaign server you can
run the script as follows:   SERVER=yes ./wesnoth.SlackBuild

please note that the server UID and GID are not required at compile time but
will be required at runtime under the UID/GID specified in the buildscript.
You can create the user and group for the wesnoth server as follows:

# groupadd -g 229 wesnoth
# useradd -u 229 -d /dev/null -s /bin/false -g wesnoth wesnoth

This requires lua.
