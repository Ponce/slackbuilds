Dwarf Fortress is a sandbox game created by Bay 12 Games.

The graphics are ASCII with various tilesets available.
In Fortress Mode, the player helps their dwarves survive by declaring
areas to collect food, create workshops, create defenses, etc.
In Adventure Mode, the player takes the role of an individual who can
explore the world (including their own previously created forts).
