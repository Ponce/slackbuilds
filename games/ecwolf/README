ECWolf is an advanced source port for Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny,
and Super 3D Noah's Ark based off of the Wolf4SDL code base. ECWolf pulls
a substantial amount of code from ZDoom and aims to provide a wide array of
mod editing capabilities without the need to modify the source code. Most
importantly you will no longer need to replace entire data sets. With ECWolf
you could for example add a weapon without needing to distribute every sprite
in the game along with it. Mods will be neatly packaged into a single file
just like they are for Doom.

For players, ECWolf provides many useful features such as better control binding,
support for wide screen resolutions, and unlimited save slots. ECWolf allows you
to keep all of your game data in one directory as one binary plays all supported
games. Support for even more Wolfenstein engine games is planned for the one binary
plays all supported games. Support for even more Wolfenstein engine games is planned
for the binary plays all supported games. Support for even more Wolfenstein engine
games is planned for the future! (I know you're all waiting for Blake Stone support.)
In terms of accuracy to vanilla Wolf, it is about the same as the accuracy of ZDoom
to vanilla Doom.
