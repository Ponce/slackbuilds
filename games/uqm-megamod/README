uqm-megamod ("remastered" port of the 3DO/PC game - Star Control II)

The Ur-Quan Masters (UQM) is a port of the 3DO version of the PC game
"Star Control II". It runs on modern operating systems and is 100%
free. The UQM MegaMod is a fork of the original UQM, which includes
enhanced graphics and extra features/options.

The original UQM is also available on SBo as games/uqm. Both uqm and
uqm-megamod can be installed on the same system without conflict.

Unlike the uqm build, uqm-megamod includes all the optional
content (HD pack, 3DO music, voice, and video packs) in a single
package. Content made for uqm-megamod is not necessarily compatible
with uqm.
