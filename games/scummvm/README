ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several 
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created using 
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various 
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others. 
ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games - currently 
Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword I & II, and Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2.

If you are building this on Slamd64, execute the build script as follows:
  DISTRO=slamd64 ARCH=x86_64 ./scummvm.SlackBuild

If you build on a multicore system, add JOBS={core #} to enable parallel
compilation; for example, to start 4 build jobs simultaneously, do:
	JOBS=4 ./scummvm.SlackBuild
