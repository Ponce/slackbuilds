ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports engines created using
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, and others.
ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games - currently
Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword I & II, and Simon the Sorcerer 1 & 2.

ScummVM optionally uses libmpeg2 and fluidsynth, both are available from
SlackBuilds.org
