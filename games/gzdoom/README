gzdoom (OpenGL port of DOOM)

Enhanced OpenGL port of the official DOOM source code that also supports
Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.

This is the latest version of gzdoom, which may not run well
on older/slower systems. If you have problems, try running with
"-glversion 3.3". If it still won't start, or doesn't run smoothly on
your system, try installing gzdoom-legacy instead. Note that gzdoom
and gzdoom-legacy conflict: only install one or the other.

See README_SBo.txt for optional runtime dependencies.

Note to 32-bit users: gzdoom requires the SSE2 extension. If you
get "illegal instruction" errors when trying to run gzdoom, your
CPU doesn't have SSE2, and you should use gzdoom-legacy instead.
At this point (2022), there aren't that many non-SSE2 x86 CPUs still
in service, so probably this won't be a problem for you.
