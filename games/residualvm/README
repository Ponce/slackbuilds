residualvm (LucasArts 3D game engine interpreter)

ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you
to play LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango, Myst III:
Exile, and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their
data files. ResidualVM just replaces the executables shipped with the
games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never
designed!

At this point, full support for Grim Fandango is available, and Myst
III: Exile is partially supported.
