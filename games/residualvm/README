ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to
play LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from
Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. ResidualVM
just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to
play them on systems for which they were never designed!

At this point, only support for Grim Fandango is available.
