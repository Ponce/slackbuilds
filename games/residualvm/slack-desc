# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

residualvm: residualvm (LucasArts 3D game engine interpreter)
residualvm:
residualvm: ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you
residualvm: to play LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango, Myst III:
residualvm: Exile, and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their
residualvm: data files. ResidualVM just replaces the executables shipped with the
residualvm: games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never
residualvm: designed!
