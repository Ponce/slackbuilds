prboom-plus (Doom source port)

PrBoom+ is a Doom source port developed from the original PrBoom
project.

Features uncapped framerate, widescreen aspect ratios, soundfont
support, variable gamespeed, re-record, walkcam, chasecam, full
mouselook, variable FOV, and other features along with full
compatibility with the original Doom/Doom2 engines.

The documentation refers to a directory into which an IWAD
file (doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad, plutonia.wad, or the
shareware doom1.wad) may be placed. The IWAD directory is
/usr/share/games/doom. If you don't have any IWADs, install
doom_shareware_data to play shareware Doom.

Optional dependencies, autodetected:

fluidsynth - for MIDI soundfont support.
portmidi - for the PortMIDI backend. Most users won't need this.
