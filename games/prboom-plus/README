prboom-plus (Doom source port)

PrBoom+ is a Doom source port developed from the original PrBoom
project.

Features uncapped framerate, widescreen aspect ratios, soundfont
support, variable gamespeed, re-record, walkcam, chasecam, full
mouselook, variable FOV, and other features along with full
compatibility with the original Doom/Doom2 engines.

The documentation refers to a directory into which an IWAD
file (doom.wad, doom2.wad, tnt.wad, plutonia.wad, or the
shareware doom1.wad) may be placed. The IWAD directory is
/usr/share/games/doom. If you don't have any IWADs, install
doom_shareware_data to play shareware Doom.

Optional dependency, autodetected:
portmidi - for the PortMIDI backend. Most users won't need this.

*** NOTE ***

Currently the SDL MIDI player is broken. The default player in this
build is OPL2. You won't be able to select SDL from the "Preferred
MIDI Player" menu in the game options. If you have an old config
file that sets snd_midiplayer to "sdl", the music will sound *really*
messed up. If this happens, simply edit ~/.prboom-plus/prboom-plus.cfg
and remove the line containing snd_midiplayer. Or just delete the
file, to start with default settings.
