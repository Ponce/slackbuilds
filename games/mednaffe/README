Mednaffe is powerful, written in C, a GTK+ based GUI frontend for mednafen,
a game console emulator. It supports a wide set of emulated platforms, such as
NES (Famicom), SNES (Super Famicom), Mega Drive/Genesis, Sony Playstation.  

There is no other requirements for that; you can explicitly build it with
support for GTK3, by invoking

    USE_GTK3=yes ./*Build
