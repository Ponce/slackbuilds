z26 (an Atari 2600 emulator)

Z26 is one of the best emulators for the Atari 2600. The author reports
that the graphics part of the emulator is nearing perfection to a point
that there's little more to fix.

This is z26 version 2.13, the last release that was actually developed
and tested on Linux. The later 3.x series has some issues running on
Linux, and the authors aren't interested in fixing them. If you want
to try it, install games/z26v3 (which won't conflict with this build;
you can have both installed).

Note to 64-bit users: z26 is mostly written in 32-bit x86 assembly,
so it can't be built for x86_64. However, this SlackBuild can create
a package that will run on pure 64-bit Slackware, by using a prebuilt,
statically linked z26 executable.
