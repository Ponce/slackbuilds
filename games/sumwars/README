Summoning Wars is an open source role-playing game, featuring both a
single-player and a multiplayer mode for about 2 to 8 players.
It is available and proved to work for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux 
operating systems, although it might as well work in *BSD and similar
operating systems.

You will need to have built CEGUI with its optional ogre dependency.
