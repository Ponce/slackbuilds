The goal of dhewm 3 is bring DOOM 3 with the help of SDL to all suitable platforms.

Compared to the original DOOM 3, the changes of dhewm 3 worth mentioning are:

* 64bit port
* SDL for low level OS support, OpenGL and input handling
* OpenAL for audio output, all OS specific audio backends are gone
* OpenAL EFX for EAX reverb effects (read: EAX-like sound effects on all platforms/hardware)
* Better support for widescreen (and arbitrary display resolutions)
* A portable build system based on CMake

This engine will only work with the original Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil expansion pack
and not the newer Doom 3 BFG.

To build the dedicated server or to disable building the base game code, the core or d3xp
game code use:  BASE="no" CORE="no" D3XP="no" SERVER="yes" ./dhewm3.SlackBuild

Doom 3 and the Resurrection of Evil expansion pack data are not included with dhewm 3 and are
still covered by the original EULA. They must be acquired separately such as from the retail
DVDs or with SteamCMD. The data pak00*.pk4 files need to be placed in /usr/share/dhewm3/base
for Doom 3 and /usr/share/dhewm3/d3xp for RoE, symbolic links to the data directories will work.
