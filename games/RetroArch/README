RetroArch is the reference frontend for the libretro API. Popular
examples of implementations for this API includes videogame system
emulators and game engines, but also more generalized 3D programs.
These programs are instantiated as dynamic libraries. We refer to these
as "libretro cores".

libretro is an API that exposes generic audio/video/input callbacks. A
frontend for libretro (such as RetroArch) handles video output, audio
output, input and application lifecycle. A libretro core written in
portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms with very
little/no porting effort.

While RetroArch is the reference frontend for libretro, several other
projects have used the libretro interface to include support for
emulators and/or game engines. libretro is completely open and free for
anyone to use.

RetroArch will require at least one of the libretro cores to play any
games.

Optional dependencies:
  ffmpeg jack-audio-connection-kit libsixel libxkbcommon mbedtls
  miniupnpc nvidia-cg-toolkit OpenAL python3 qt5 SDL2 vulkansdk
  wayland-egl wayland-protocols

Note: Wayland support requires both wayland-egl and wayland-protocols to
be installed. Instead of installing wayland-egl mesa can be rebuilt with
Wayland support, using the following configure parameters.

  --with-egl-platforms=x11,drm,wayland

To build debugging symbols for RetroArch use:
  DEBUG=yes ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

If building debugging symbols asan can also be built:
  DEBUG=yes ASAN=yes ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

Discord integration can be enabled with:
  DISCORD=yes

Python3 support for shaders will need to be enabled with:
  PYTHON=yes ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

If pulseaudio is installed it can be disabled during the build with:
  PULSE=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

The Qt5 frontend can be disabled with:
  QT=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

The materialui menu driver can be disabled with:
  GLUI=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

The ozone menu driver can be disabled with:
  OZONE=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

The rgui menu driver can be disabled with:
  RGUI=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

The xmb menu driver can be disabled with:
  XMB=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

All of the menu drivers can be disabled with:
  MENU=no ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

Alternatively pulseaudio can be disabled later in RetroArch's
configuration.

Retroarch optionally supports using OpenGL ES 2 and OpenGL ES 3 instead
of OpenGL which will require video card and driver support. This can be
done by building RetroArch with:
  GLES=yes ./RetroArch.SlackBuild
or
  GLES3=yes ./RetroArch.SlackBuild

RetroArch optionally supports using Vulkan instead of OpenGL, this will
require the vulkansdk from SBo and support for your video card and
driver.
