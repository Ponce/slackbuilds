Following features are new in this build:

  - Contains a few bugfixes for version 0.5.1.r1.
  - Corrects the stats of a few ship-parts because they do not
    behave in the same way that similiar parts behave.
    This is done by default. If this is not wanted then use

      PARTSFIX=NO ./vegastrike.SlackBuild

    to build the package.
  - The server will not be build by default since it is experimental
    at this stage. If you want to build the server anyway then use

      DISABLE_SERVER=OFF ./vegastrike.SlackBuild


HINTS:

  - After installation run 'vssetup' and adjust the settings
    before you launch 'vegastrike'.
  - You can quit the game either by pressing ESC and then 'q'
    during flight or by clicking 'Quit Game' on a save screen.
