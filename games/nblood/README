nblood (game engine for Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Powerslave/Exhumed)

nblood is a collection of reverse-engineered ports of Build games using
EDuke32 engine technology and development principles.

This package only includes the game engines. You'll have to provide the
game data to actually play any of the games. See README_game_data.txt
for the list of supported games and the data required for each one.

Optional dependency: isextract. This is only needed to extract the game
data from the Blood install CD.
