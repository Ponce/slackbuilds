nblood (game engine for Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Powerslave/Exhumed)

nblood is a collection of reverse-engineered ports of Build games
using EDuke32 engine technology and development principles. Currently
supported games are Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Powerslave aka Exhumed.

By default, the package only includes the game engines. You'll have
to provide the game data to actually play any of the games. See
README_game_data.txt for the list of supported game versions and the
data required for each one.

Optional dependency: isextract. This is only needed to extract the
game data from the Blood install CD or iso.
