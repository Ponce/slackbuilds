Dolphin is an emulator for two recent Nintendo video game consoles:
the GameCube and the Wii. It allows PC gamers to enjoy games for these
two consoles in full HD (1080p) with several enhancements:
compatibility with all PC controllers, turbo speed, networked
multiplayer, and even more!

Dolphin will optionally build against internal system packages if
present, these include: SFML, cubeb, enet, hidapi, mbedtls, libminizip,
libspng, miniupnpc, pugixml, and zstd-cmake.

Analytic data collection is disabled by default. To enable analytics,
pass ANALYTICS=ON to the build script, users will be prompted about
this on first launch.

Discord Rich Presence is disabled by default, to enable Discord
functionality, pass DISCORD=ON to the build script.

Disassembly is enabled by default, which requires llvm >= 18. To
disable disassembly support, pass LLVM=OFF to the build script.
