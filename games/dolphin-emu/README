Dolphin is an emulator for two recent Nintendo video game consoles:
the GameCube and the Wii. It allows PC gamers to enjoy games for these
two consoles in full HD (1080p) with several enhancements:
compatibility with all PC controllers, turbo speed, networked
multiplayer, and even more!

Optional dependencies: SFML, cubeb, fmt, gtest, hidapi, jack, mbedtls,
miniupnpc, pugixml, qt6

Analytic data collection is enabled by default, however, users are
prompted about this on first launch. To disable analytics without being
prompted, pass ANALYTICS=OFF to the build script.

Discord Rich Presence is disabled by default, to enable Discord
functionality, pass DISCORD=ON to the build script.

If you would like to disable Gameboy Advance controller support, pass
USEMGBA=OFF to the build script. This will remove the mgba dependecy.
