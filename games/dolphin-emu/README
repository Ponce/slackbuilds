Dolphin is a Gamecube, Wii and Triforce (the arcade machine based on
the Gamecube) emulator which supports many extra features and
abilities not present on the original consoles. Gamecube and Wii
compatibility is good - one can expect "mainstream" titles to run;
lesser known titles can be hit or miss. Triforce compatibility is
currently limited to a couple of games - others require more of the
Triforce-specific peripheral devices to be emulated.

Optional dependencies: are SFML, OpenAL, portaudio, pulseaudio, soil,
SDL2, miniupnpc, soundtouch, ffmpeg and wxGTK3

Optional dependencies (not used): wayland and polarssl (version < 1.3)

Note: Wayland support is not enabled even if it is installed. Dolphin
requires mesa to be rebuilt with Wayland support using the following
configure parameters.

  --with-egl-platforms=x11,drm,wayland

In addition to adding Wayland support to mesa, libxkbcommon needs to
be installed (version >= 0.4.0) that also requires xcb >= 1.10.

Note: polarssl is not use as the version at SBo is too new.
