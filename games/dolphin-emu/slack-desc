# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dolphin-emu: abilities not present on the original consoles. Gamecube and Wii
dolphin-emu: compatibility is good - one can expect "mainstream" titles to run;
dolphin-emu: lesser known titles can be hit or miss. Triforce compatibility is
dolphin-emu: currently limited to a couple of games - others require more of the
