mGBA is an emulator for running Game Boy Advance games. It aims to be
faster and more accurate than many existing Game Boy Advance
emulators, as well as adding features that other emulators lack.

The following optional dependencies will be automatically detected.

* SDL2
* libedit (for the command-line debugger)
* ffmpeg

If you have Qt 5 and CMake 3, then you can build mGBA with a GUI:

    QT=on ./mGBA.SlackBuild

As an alternative to running mGBA as an application, you might consider
running RetroArch with its mGBA core. RetroArch SlackBuilds, including
one for its mGBA core, are here:
