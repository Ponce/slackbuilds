retux (2d platform game)

ReTux is a 100% libre software and 100% libre culture action platformer
loosely inspired by the Mario games, utilizing the art assets from the
SuperTux project. The name "ReTux" is a play on the words "redux" and
"Tux". Although ReTux re-uses the art assets of SuperTux, no code from
SuperTux is used in ReTux.
