# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

retux: ReTux is a 100% libre software and 100% libre culture action
retux: platformer loosely inspired by the Mario games, utilizing the art
retux: assets from the SuperTux project. The name "ReTux" is a play on the
retux: words "redux" and "Tux". Although ReTux re-uses the art assets of
retux: SuperTux, no code from SuperTux is used in ReTux.
