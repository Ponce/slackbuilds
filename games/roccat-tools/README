The roccat-tools package contains the userland applications needed to
configure and make extended use of the supported Roccat devices. It
consists of a shared library and other files shared by device specific
applications for Roccat hardware.

Currently the following devices are supported:

# Keyboards
Arvo (ROC-12-500) [arvo]
Isku (ROC-12-700) [isku]
IskuFX (ROC-12-900) [iskufx]
Ryos MK/Glow/Pro (ROC-12-601, ROC-12-750, ROC-12-850) [ryosmk]
Ryos TKL Pro (ROC-12-650) [ryostkl]

# Mice
Kone (ROC-11-500, ROC-11-501) [kone]
Kone[+] (ROC-11-800) [koneplus]
KonePure (ROC-11-700) [konepure]
KonePureMilitary (ROC-11-711) [konepuremilitary]
KonePureOptical (ROC-11-710) [konepureoptical]
KonePureOpticalBlack (ROC-11-714-B) [konepureoptical]
KoneXTD (ROC-11-810) [konextd]
KoneXTDOptical (ROC-11-811) [konextdoptical]
Kova[+] (ROC-11-520) [kovaplus]
Lua (ROC-11-310) [lua]
Nyth (ROC-11-900, ?) [nyth]
Pyra (ROC-11-300, ROC-11-510) [pyra]
Savu (ROC-11-600) [savu]
Tyon Black/White (ROC-11-850, ROC-11-851) [tyon]

Support for all devices is built by default. To compile support for a
specific device set the DEVICES variable to a semicolon delimited list
of devices to compile support for, such as

	DEVICES="isku;koneplus"

You will need a dedicated group to run roccat-tools. This will add the
'roccat' group and not conflict with anything else on SBo:

	groupadd -r -g 318 roccat

Set the GROUP variable to whatever you create here before running the 
script, otherwise the default 'roccat' will be used.

To use the device features as normal user you have to add yourself and
all other users to the group that was created

	usermod -a -G $GROUP $USER

Do a logout/login to apply your new group ownership and replug your
device and everything should work as expected.

You can optionally compile support for Lua 5.1 or 5.2 if you want
scripting possibilities. This will add lua or lua52 as a dependency,
both available at SBo. Set the Lua version like this:

	LUAVERSION="5.1"

If you have an old Kone (ROC-11-500, ROC-11-501) you, in certain cases,
may additionally need the kmod-roccat package which is currently not 
avaiable at SBo.

# This package contains

* roccateventhandler

	A eventhandler that takes care of displaying OSD events and handles
	quicklaunching and talk events.

* roccatDEVICEcontrol

	A console application mainly meant as helper for background tasks.
	For basic usage information on roccatDEVICEcontrol please read
	the manpage.

* roccatDEVICEconfig

	Graphical user interfaces to modify the profiles of your devices.
	You should find them in the settings folder of your window
	manager, or you can call them from the console.

# Known issues

	If you get annoying SHIFT_L key events when entering keys in
	DEVICEconfig you might have a video application like xine running
	which tries to disable the screensaver in the most stupid way. You
	have to switch off this functionality or close the culprit.

	If some key events don't show up in DEVICEconfig then you might have
	software like xbindkeys running. You have to turn off these tools
	for editing keys or macros in DEVICEconfig. Another possibility is
	that the translation table is missing some keys (in fact at this
	time it only supports a standard 105-keys keyboard)
