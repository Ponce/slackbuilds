espeakup is a program which makes it possible for speakup to use
the espeak software synthesizer. It does this by reading speakup's
softsynth device and passing the text to espeak which actually speaks

This program works with the speakup screen reader, which is included
in the kernel provided by Slackware.

This program should be run after speakup is set up to communicate with a
software synthesizer and after /dev/softsynth exists.

This requires espeak.
