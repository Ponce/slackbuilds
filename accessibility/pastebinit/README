pastebinit (command-line pastebin client)

pastebinit is a small python script that simply sends whatever you give
it to an online pastebin and gives you the URL in return. It’s useful
when doing IRC support (when you don’t want one to paste a 200 lines
log) or when working on a command line box with no way to SSH in it.
