unclutter-xfixes (x11 tool for removing mouse clutter from the screen)

Hides the mouse pointer when the mouse isn't moving.

This is a rewrite of the popular tool unclutter, but using the
x11-xfixes extension. This means that this rewrite doesn't use fake
windows or pointer grabbing and hence causes less problems with window
managers and/or applications.

Notes:

- The binary is called unclutter, not unclutter-xfixes.

- This build conflicts with the regular unclutter build. Only one
  should be installed, either unclutter or unclutter-xfixes.

- The usual way to start unclutter is from ~/.xinitrc.

- The options are different (--timeout and --jitter, not -idle and
  -jitter), make sure you read the man page.
