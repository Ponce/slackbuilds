eflite is a speech server for Emacspeak and other screen readers that
allow them to interface with Flite.

NOTE:

If you are using flite and eflite to interface with emacspeak, then
you will also have to set some environment variables:

As user:
echo 'DTK_PROGRAM=/usr/local/bin/eflite; export DTK_PROGRAM' >> ~/.bash_profile

For a completely vision-free system, you may add these steps:

As root:
echo 'exec /usr/local/bin/flite -t "please log in"' >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

As user:
echo 'exec /usr/bin/emacspeak' >> ~/.bash_profile
