ydotool (send fake keyboard/mouse events to the kernel)

ydotool is an automation tool, similar to xdotool, but it doesn't
require X. It can be used to send input to console or wayland
applications, as well as X.

ydotool works differently from xdotool. xdotool sends X events
directly to X server, while ydotool uses the uinput framework of Linux
kernel to emulate an input device.

To use ydotool, the user must have read/write access to /dev/uinput.
On Slackware, this means ydotool would need root access. This
SlackBuild installs ydotool setuid root, but only users in the
'console' group can run it. Since 'console' users can already use the
real keyboard and mouse, it doesn't seem like a huge security risk to
let them send fake events. If this bothers you, run the script with
SETUID=no in the environment to disable it.
