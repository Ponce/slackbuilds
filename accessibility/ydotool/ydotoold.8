ydotoold - daemon for \fBydotool\fR(1)
.P
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBydotoold\fR
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBydotool\fR lets you programmatically (or manually) simulate
keyboard input and mouse activity, etc.\& It does this by writing
directly to \fB/dev/uinput\fR so it generally needs to run as root.\&
.P
When \fBydotool\fR(1) runs and creates a virtual input device, it will take some time for your graphical environment (eg X11/Wayland) to recognize and enable the virtual input device.\& (Usually done by udev)
.P
If the delay is too short, the virtual input device may not be recognized & enabled by the graphical environment in time.\&
.P
In order to solve this problem, the \fBydotoold\fR background service holds a persistent virtual device, and accepts input from \fBydotool\fR(1).\& When \fBydotoold\fR(1) is unavailable, \fBydotool\fR(1) will work without it.\&
