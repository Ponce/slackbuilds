svkbd (simple virtual keyboard)

This is a simple virtual keyboard, intended to be used in environments
where no keyboard is available.

The default font and other options can be set in config.h (in the same
directory as the SlackBuild). To do this, extract config.def.h from
the source, copy it to config.h, and edit.

The key layouts are set with the environment variable LAYOUTS, which
can be set to a space-separated list of one or more of:

mobile-intl - Multilayer international (QWERTY)
mobule-plain - Two-layered international (QWERTY)
mobile-simple - Two-layered minimalistic (QWERTY)
arrows - Arrow keys only
en - English (QWERTY)
de - German (QWERTZ)
ru - Russian (Cyrillic)
sh - Slavic (QWERTZ)
all - All of the above

Default value for LAYOUTS is "en mobile-intl".

The package will contain binaries for each layout (e.g. svkbd-en,
svkbd-ru) in /usr/bin. The first layout listed in LAYOUTS (or svkbd-en
if LAYOUTS="all") will also be symlinked to /usr/bin/svkbd.
