# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

espeak: eSpeak (a compact open source software speech synthesizer)
espeak:
espeak: eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different
espeak: synthesis method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines,
espeak: and sounds quite different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth",
espeak: but some find the articulation clearer and easier to listen to for
espeak: long periods. It can run as a command line program to speak text from
espeak: a file or from stdin.
