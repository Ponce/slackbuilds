# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-hashed-storage: haskell-hashed-storage (Hashed file storage support code)
haskell-hashed-storage:
haskell-hashed-storage: Support code for reading and manipulating hashed file storage (where
haskell-hashed-storage: each file and directory is associated with a cryptographic hash, for
haskell-hashed-storage: corruption-resistant storage and fast comparisons).
haskell-hashed-storage:
haskell-hashed-storage: The supported storage formats include darcs hashed pristine, a plain
haskell-hashed-storage: filesystem tree and an indexed plain tree (where the index maintains
haskell-hashed-storage: hashes of the plain files and directories).
