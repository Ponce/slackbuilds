# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-tf-random: haskell-tf-random (High-quality splittable PRNG)
haskell-tf-random:
haskell-tf-random: This package contains an implementation of a high-quality splittable
haskell-tf-random: pseudorandom number generator. The generator is based on a
haskell-tf-random: cryptographic hash function built on top of the ThreeFish block
haskell-tf-random: cipher. See the paper Splittable Pseudorandom Number Generators
haskell-tf-random: Using Cryptographic Hashing by Claessen, Pałka for details and the
haskell-tf-random: rationale of the design.
