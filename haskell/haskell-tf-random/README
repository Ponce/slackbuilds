This package contains an implementation of a high-quality splittable
pseudorandom number generator. The generator is based on a
cryptographic hash function built on top of the ThreeFish block
cipher. See the paper Splittable Pseudorandom Number Generators
Using Cryptographic Hashing by Claessen, Pałka for details and the
rationale of the design.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from
