# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

haskell-QuickCheck: haskell-QuickCheck (Automatic testing of Haskell programs)
haskell-QuickCheck:
haskell-QuickCheck: QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.
haskell-QuickCheck: The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form
haskell-QuickCheck: of properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then
haskell-QuickCheck: tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly
haskell-QuickCheck: generated cases.
