A Haskell binding to the X11 graphics library.  The binding is a
direct translation of the C binding; for documentation of these calls,
refer to The Xlib Programming Manual, available online at
http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/.

This requires ghc and haskell-syb from SlackBuilds.org.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
