Gloss hides the pain of drawing simple vector graphics behind a nice
data type and a few display functions.  Gloss uses OpenGL under the
hood, but you won't need to worry about any of that.  Get something
cool on the screen in under 10 minutes.

This requires ghc, haskell-ObjectName, haskell-OpenGLRaw,
haskell-StateVar, haskell-Tensor, haskell-binary, haskell-GLURaw,
haskell-bmp, haskell-OpenGL and haskell-GLUT.
