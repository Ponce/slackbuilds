Haskeline provides a user interface for line input in command-line
programs.  This library is similar in purpose to readline, but since
it is written in Haskell, it is (hopefully) more easily used in other
Haskell programs.

This requires ghc, haskell-transformers, haskell-mtl,
haskell-terminfo, and haskell-utf8-string.

After uninstalling, run this command to unregister the package from the ghc
package database:   ghc-pkg recache
